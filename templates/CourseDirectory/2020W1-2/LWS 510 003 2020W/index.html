<p><u>Seminars</u>:</p>
<p>Fridays 14:00 – 15:00 PDT</p>
<p><em>*Unless otherwise indicated</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>COURSE DESCRIPTION</u></p>
<p>Weekly seminar series addressing current and emerging issues relevant within the general context of land and water systems, and the significance of professional credibility and exposure.</p>
<p>There are no prerequisites for this course.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>COURSE STRUCTURE</u></p>
<p>Weekly virtual meetings will include students, UBC faculty and occasional guest speakers, including practicing professionals. Each week there will be an oral presentation, followed by an open discussion. Certain seminar presentations may be open to the broader university community and the public; they may involve panel discussions and/or group workshops. Students who wish to receive academic credit must regularly participate in the weekly seminars.</p>
<p>MLWS students enrolled in LWS 510 are required to complete 2 short presentations, one brief introduction in term 1 and one Major Project Proposal seminar in term 2. These presentations are aimed for a general professional audience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Term 1: Each student will give a 2-minute introduction with one image as an accompanying visual aid. This introduction should spark interest in the audience – it should be memorable, yet professional (think of the audience as members of a professional association or conference attendees). These will take place on <strong>September 18th</strong> (see schedule on the Canvas home page).</li>
<li>Term 2: Each student will give a 10-minute presentation on their Major Project proposal. These will take place all together over two to three seminar periods in March 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p><u> </u></p>
<p><u>SCHEDULE OF TOPICS </u></p>
<p>See attached sheet for Term 1 schedule. Term 2 schedule will be shared in January.</p>
<p><u>LEARNING OUTCOMES</u></p>
<p>As a result of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engage in informed debate and utilize critical analytical skills in delivering public presentations.</li>
<li>Provide informed insights into a breadth of issues central to land and water systems</li>
<li>Select formats for oral discourse for professional dialogue congruent with nature of the audience, information details and objectives of presentations.</li>
<li>Present topics focused on land and water systems in a seminar format and make informed comment on issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall <em>course objective</em> is to provide instruction and experience in effective and informed oral communication for practicing natural resource professionals.</p>
<p><u> </u></p>
<p><u>ASSESSMENT OF LEARNING</u></p>
<p><u>Oral Presentations (60%):</u> Students are expected to come prepared, engage the audience, show creativity and present with effective communication aids (2 presentations = 60%). Evaluation is guided by the following grading rubric:</p>

<p><u>Participation </u><u>(40%)</u><u>:</u> Students are expected to actively engage in discussions, ask questions and attend all seminars. To give everyone a chance to participate, each student will be assigned as a designated “question asker” for at least one seminar period in the course. This student will lead the question period following a seminar presentation, then it will open to all participants. More information will be provided in class.</p>
<p>Class participation will be evaluated by the instructors, with a mark recorded for each student using the following rubric:</p>
<ul>
<li>A score of "1" would be awarded if the student failed to prepare for the class, had not listened carefully to what other classmates were saying, had either not communicated or communicated poorly during the class, had been disrespectful and/or had made no contribution in class.</li>
<li>A score of "2" would be awarded if the student’s awareness, listening skills, communication, respectfulness and contributions allowed the student to make small but limited contributions to the class discussion.</li>
<li>A score of "3" would be awarded if the student’s awareness, listening skills, communication, respectfulness and contributions allowed that student to participate actively and courteously in the class discussion and enhance the class’s understanding of the subject materials, the issues at hand and provide some suggestions for resolving the issues under discussion.</li>
<li>A score of "4" would be awarded if the student’s awareness was very good, listened carefully at all times to other classmates, communicated clearly, respected the contributions of other members and made a substantial contribution to the understanding and resolution of the issues in discussion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A score of "5" would be awarded if the student demonstrated outstanding and/or excellent performance in any category.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Note</u></strong><u>: Students will lose 5% off their final grade if they miss, without written approval, 3 sessions in total over the two terms.</u></p>

<p><u>UNIVERSITY POLICIES</u></p>
<p>UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access, including those for survivors of abuse or violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is the suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions.</p>
<p>Details of the policies and how to access support are available on the UBC Senate website.</p>
