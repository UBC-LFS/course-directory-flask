<p>Students registered in FRE 500 and FRE 600 will attend and participate in the existing <em>Work In Progress</em> (WIP) seminar series, which is managed by the Food and Resource Economics (FRE) group. What distinguishes FRE 500 and FRE 600 is the required level of attendance and participation (details below). The WIP seminar series is regularly attended by applied economists from various UBC departments who are interested in issues concerning natural resources and the environment, including global food security. These economists, together with visiting scholars, postdocs and graduate students, regularly present their research in the WIP series, which runs in both terms of the Winter Session. The goal is for WIP seminar to be held between 8 – 10 times per semester.</p>
<p><strong>Objective of FRE 500 and FRE 600</strong></p>
<p> The purpose of the FRE 500 and FRE 600 graduate seminar courses is to provide ISLFS graduate students who have an economics specialization:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exposure to the research projects of UBC faculty members, visiting scholars and other graduate students in the general area of food and resource economics;</li>
<li>The opportunity to network with UBC faculty members in order to explore collaboration, identify potential members of a supervisory or examination committee, and be introduced to visiting scholars; and</li>
<li>An informal environment that encourages faculty-student mentoring, active engagement in discussion and debate and multiple opportunities to present and discuss research findings.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>After completing FRE 500 or FRE 600 students should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the various methods and techniques that applied economists use when presenting their research findings in a small seminar environment;</li>
<li>Identify the various methods and techniques that applied economists use when answering technical and non-technical questions from the audience;</li>
<li>Provide constructive criticism of a research paper and the presentation of the paper in a seminar environment;</li>
<li>Identify an assortment of statistical methods that applied economists use when analyzing economics-focused datasets; and</li>
<li>Describe several emerging topics of research and the body of literature that is associated with this research.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<p>All MSc students in ISLFS program who are taking FRE 500, and all PhD students in the ISLFS program who are taking FRE 600 instead of LFS 500 must fully participate according to the requirements specified below in order to receive a passing grade. The requirements are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Students must attend 80 percent of the WIP seminars that are offered for a minimum of 24 months for MSc students, and a minimum of 36 months for PhD students. Exceptions are made for students who are conducting research away from Vancouver. If the Food and Resource Economics (FRE) group hosts an ad hoc seminar as a substitute for the WIP seminar on a one-off basis, then this ad hoc seminar is equivalent to a WIP when determining required attendance.</li>
<li>students in FRE 500 must make three presentations, which includes an open-topic seminar in year 1, a research proposal seminar in year 2 and a results seminar in years 2 or 3. PhD students in FRE 600 must make four or more presentations, which includes an open-topic seminar in year 1, a research proposal seminar in year 2, a progress seminar each year of the following until the student is ready to defend, and a results seminar shortly before the student’s defense. For example, a PhD student who takes five years to complete the program will be required to present five times (once per year).</li>
<li>MSc students in FRE 500 and PhD students in FRE 600 must serve as a discussant once in the first term and once in the second term of the Winter Session for each year they are registered (year 1 is excluded).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Guidelines</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The topic for each presentation, which must be related to the student’s research area, must be approved by the student’s supervisory committee. Student presentations are a maximum of 50 minutes in length followed by a 10-minute question period.</li>
<li>Those who come to the WIP seminar series are a mix of faculty members, visiting scholars, post docs and other graduate students with varying academic backgrounds. The student’s presentation must therefore be accessible to a diverse audience, which means placing less emphasis on the technical features of the analysis and more emphasis on the underlying assumptions of the model, the empirical results and the economic intuition.</li>
<li>Discussing a paper requires reading the working paper and/or the slides and meeting with the presenter at least one day before the presentation. Immediately after the main presentation the discussant will use a small number of slides and in 5 minutes or less describe the paper’s key contributions, its main shortcomings and the pathways for improvement.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first responsibility for scheduling presentations and serving as a discussant within the WIP series lies with the graduate student. The second responsibility for ensuring that graduate students are meeting their seminar participation requirements lies with graduate students’ supervisors.</p>
