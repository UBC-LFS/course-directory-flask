<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</span></strong></p>
<p>UBC’s Point Grey Campus is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xwməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam) people. The land it is situated on has always been a place of learning for the Musqueam people, who for millennia have passed on in their culture, history, and traditions from one generation to the next on this site.</p>

<p><u>SEMINARS</u></p>
<p>Mondays 13:00 – 14:00, MCML 258* (2357 Main Mall)</p>
<p><em>*Unless otherwise indicated (see <strong>Course Structure</strong> below)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>COURSE DESCRIPTION</u></p>
<p>Weekly seminar series addressing current and emerging issues relevant within the general context of land and water systems, and the significance of professional credibility and exposure.</p>
<p>There are no prerequisites for this course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>COURSE STRUCTURE</u></p>
<p>Weekly meetings will include students, UBC faculty and occasional guest speakers, including practicing professionals. Each week there will be an oral presentation, followed by an open discussion. </p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #169179;"><strong><em>&nbsp;“Be Flexible”</em></strong></span></h4>
<p><em>The ever-changing response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will present some uncertainty to UBC course offerings this semester. The LWS 510 seminar series will have a more flexible structure this year to accommodate students’ changing needs. Some seminars will be in a classroom setting, while others may be online via Zoom. Some seminars will be recorded, while you will have access to presentation slides for others. All course materials will be available to students on Canvas. <u>In general, students are expected to be on campus, ready to attend the seminar in-class</u>; you will be notified each week about the delivery format of the next session.</em></p>
<p>MLWS students enrolled in LWS 510 are required to complete three short presentations, one brief introduction in term 1 and term 2, and one Major Project Proposal seminar in term 2. These presentations are aimed at a general professional audience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Term 1: Each student will give a 2-minute introduction with one image as an accompanying visual aid. This introduction should spark interest in the audience – it should be memorable, yet professional (think of the audience as members of a professional association or conference attendees). These will take place on <strong>September 19<sup>th</sup> in class</strong>.</li>
<li>Term 2: A 2-minute presentation to update the class on your Major Project interests. These will take place on the first day of LWS 510 in Term 2, <strong>January 9th, 2023</strong>. </li>
<li>Term 2: Each student will give a 10-minute presentation on their Major Project proposal. These will take place all together over two to three seminar periods in March 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>COVID-19 Safety in the Classroom:</strong></span></h3>
<p>It is important that all of us feel as comfortable as possible engaging in-class activities while sharing an indoor space. Non-medical masks that cover our noses and mouths are a primary tool to make it harder for COVID-19 to find a new host. Please wear a non-medical mask during our class meetings, for your protection, and the safety and comfort of everyone else in the class.</p>
<p>If you have not yet had a chance to get vaccinated against COVID-19, vaccines are available to you for free [<a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/covid-19/vaccine/register">https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/covid-19/vaccine/register</a>]. The higher the rate of vaccination in our community overall, the lower the chance of spreading this virus. You are an important part of this community. Please arrange to get vaccinated if you have not already done so.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: If you are feeling unwell, please DO NOT come to class. This is to protect the health and safety of all students, staff and faculty at UBC. Please email one of the instructors before the scheduled Seminar to inform us if you are unable to attend.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can download UBC Safe Vancouver App to conduct a daily health assessment before using public and shared spaces on campus. For more information, and to download the app, visit the UBC Safety &amp; Risk Services website [</strong><a href="https://srs.ubc.ca/health-safety/ubc-safe-vancouver-app"><strong>https://srs.ubc.ca/health-safety/ubc-safe-vancouver-app</strong></a><strong>] </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>SCHEDULE OF TOPICS </u></p>
<p>The Term 1 seminar schedule will be shared in the first class on September 12th. Term 2 schedule will be shared in January.</p>

<p><u>Participation </u><u>(40%)</u><u>:</u> <span>Students are expected to actively engage in discussions, ask questions and attend seminars (either in-person or virtually). To give everyone a chance to participate, each student will be assigned as a designated “Question asker” for at least one seminar period in the course. This student will lead the question period following a seminar presentation, then it will open to all participants. More information will be provided in class.</span></p>
<p>Class participation will be evaluated by the instructors, with a mark recorded for each student using the following rubric:</p>
<ul>
<li>A score of "1" would be awarded if the student failed to prepare for the class, had not listened carefully to what other classmates were saying, had either not communicated or communicated poorly during the class, had been disrespectful and/or had made no contribution in class.</li>
<li>A score of "2" would be awarded if the student’s awareness, listening skills, communication, respectfulness and contributions allowed the student to make small but limited contributions to the class discussion.</li>
<li>A score of "3" would be awarded if the student’s awareness, listening skills, communication, respectfulness and contributions allowed that student to participate actively and courteously in the class discussion and enhance the class’s understanding of the subject materials, the issues at hand and provide some suggestions for resolving the issues under discussion.</li>
<li>A score of "4" would be awarded if the student’s awareness was very good, listened carefully at all times to other classmates, communicated clearly, respected the contributions of other members and made a substantial contribution to the understanding and resolution of the issues in discussion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A score of "5" would be awarded if the student demonstrated outstanding and/or excellent performance in any category.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Note</u></strong><u>: Students will lose 5% off their final grade if they miss, without written approval, 3 sessions in total over the two terms.</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>OTHER UNIVERSITY POLICIES</u></p>
<p>UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access, including those for survivors of abuse or violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and religious observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions.</p>
<p>Details of the policies and how to access support are available on the UBC Senate website [<a href="https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success">https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success</a>]</p>
