<p>There are separate syllabi for term 1 and 2 in year 5. We will post each one here at the start of each term. Many of the syllabus details are similar for term 1 and 2, but there are key differences (e.g. assignments, schedule)</p>
<p>The course syllabi outline the expectations for the courses and contain weekly schedules. The schedules may change as we move through the courses, based on instructor evaluation and student feedback.</p>
<p>Please read through the syllabus during the first week of each term. We will also review key details in class.</p>
