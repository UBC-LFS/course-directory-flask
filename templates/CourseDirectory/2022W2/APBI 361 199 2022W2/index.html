<p><strong>Land Acknowledgement</strong></p>
<p>UBC’s Point Grey Campus is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xwməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam) people. The land it is situated on has always been a place of learning for the Musqueam people, who for millennia have passed on their culture, history, and traditions from one generation to the next on this site.</p>
<p>As a newcomer and settler to the traditional territories of many distinct First Nations, I am grateful to be instructing this web-oriented course focused on learning how to sustain resources for food production and livelihoods from a place that stands within the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territories of the <a href="https://native-land.ca/">Hul’qumi’num Treaty Group</a>.</p>
<p>Many Coast Salish peoples make their homes, livelihoods, and thrive in these lands and waters, despite the ongoing dispossession of their home territory and livelihood resources through unlawful acts and impacts of colonialism. Since time immemorial, the six First Nations comprising the Hul’qumi’num People and Territories have created and maintained distinct systems of governance, knowledge-keeping, and stewardship of their homelands where I am now also living and working. I am indebted to and thankful for the Quw’utsun, Halalt, Penelakut, Ts’uubaa-asatx, and Lyackson peoples of the <a href="https://native-land.ca/">Hul’qumi’num Treaty Group</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Course Teaching Assistant: Daphne Chevalier (she, her):</strong> Contact via Canvas course email and view Daphne's introduction on the course introductions page.</p>
<p><strong>Course Description</strong></p>
<p>APBI361 offers an exploration of contemporary models and measurements of sustainable agriculture as developed by policymakers, non-government organizations, academic researchers, and for-profit commercial enterprises. Students will encounter the complexity, challenges, and limits of sustainability indicators at global, national, and regional scales. Agroecosystem sustainability examples are intended to inspire critical thinking, to connect with your everyday life and/or with your future career in agriculture and food systems.</p>
<p>The course goal is to provide an opportunity for students to explore the ways agriculture and food systems sustainability is measured, and to critically examine these sustainability assessments with support from peers and the teaching team.</p>
<p><strong>Course Structure</strong></p>
<p>APBI361, centered on a study of the ‘Key Indicators of Agroecosystem Sustainability’, was designed primarily as a web-based course. <u>Team-based learning activities and assignments will require some coordination of your schedule with your peers</u>, but there are no required synchronous lectures or final exams for this course.</p>
<p>Course readings and all assignments are located within the APBI361 Canvas course website. Students will be responsible for familiarizing themselves with the course site, where, how, and when to submit each assignment, and take responsibility for communicating regularly with classmates and the instructor.</p>
<p><strong>Course Schedule</strong></p>
<p>The schedule for the course is organized on a weekly basis, with nearly all assignments due on Fridays. The weekly course schedule, links to the learning modules and assignments can be found on the APBI361 home page in Canvas.</p>
<p><u>Any change to the course schedule will be communicated with Canvas Course Announcements</u>.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Materials</strong></p>
<p>All learning materials for this course will be provided on the Canvas course website. No additional textbook or other purchases required.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>What is academic integrity?</u></strong></p>
<p>The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This working definition of ‘academic integrity’ was created by Dr. Catherine Rawn, was suggested by the Centre for Teaching and Learning at UBC and carries a Creative Commons license.</p>
<p>Much of the written work in this course on “Key Indicators of Agroecosystem Sustainability” will rely on your individual reflections and on the exercise of writing as critical thinking. We will be using the Turnitin tool to collect and review written assignments in APBI361.</p>
<p>To help you learn your responsibilities as a student in this course, please read and understand UBC’s expectations for academic honesty in the UBC Calendar: “<a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,286,0,0">Academic Honesty</a>,” “<a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,959">Academic Misconduct</a>,” and “<a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,960">Disciplinary Measures</a>,”. Read and reflect on the<a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,285,0,0"> Student Declaration and Responsibility</a>.</p>
<p><strong><u>Where can I find support to meet these expectations?</u></strong></p>
<p>There are resources to help you meet these expectations, for example the Chapman Learning Commons<a href="http://learningcommons.ubc.ca/resource-guides/avoid-plagiarism/"> "Understand Academic Integrity"</a>.&nbsp;For written assignments and help with plagiarism and citation, see the <a href="https://writing.library.ubc.ca/?login">Centre for Writing and Scholarly Communication</a>.</p>
<p>Additional resources for learning with integrity can be found on the UBC <a href="academicintegrity.ubc.ca">Academic Integrity Website</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Please reach out to me with any questions you may have about this</strong>, either with a request for scheduling a meeting time in our virtual office, or with questions and responses that can be shared with all students on our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) discussion board.</p>
<p><u>Final notes and examples to help identify when Academic Integrity is violated</u></p>
<p>All students are subject to the University's&nbsp;rules&nbsp;on <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,959">Academic Misconduct</a> and have a responsibility at all times to behave according to the standards of integrity that are required of all members of the academic community.</p>
<p>Plagiarism is a serious offence and any student caught plagiarizing will be subject to penalties set out in the&nbsp;UBC calendar. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copying or paraphrasing from another author or source without proper citation</li>
<li>Copying work from another student</li>
<li>Copying your own work used for another course without clear acknowledgement and rationale</li>
<li>The use of Chat GPT and similar online resources that generate text responses or research papers in substitution for your own reflections and original writing</li>
<li><a href="https://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0">https://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0</a></li>
<li>Broadly, any form of intellectual theft where <em>‘another's’</em> (inclusive of AI) work or ideas are presented as another individual's assignment</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Academic Integrity and written acknowledgement of learning resources in APBI361</strong></p>
<p>The accepted citation-acknowledgement format for all written assignments in APBI361 is the American Psychological Association (APA) format.&nbsp;<u>You are expected to follow this format for all written assignments. </u></p>
<p><u>Specific examples for citation and acknowledgement of a slightly modified APA format within Discussion Assignments are provided in the Discussion Assignment Guidelines (</u>Week 1 Learning Module)<u>.</u></p>
<p>In brief, the APA writing style aims to promote objectivity in communicating science, and the APA format is a means to standardize reports across the scientific community (Schwartz, Landrum, &amp; Guring, 2013). More detailed information about this format, including how to cite references correctly can be found&nbsp;here <a href="https://guides.library.ubc.ca/apacitationstyle">https://guides.library.ubc.ca/apacitationstyle</a> and&nbsp;here<u> </u><a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html">https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html</a></p>
<p>In contrast to the use of the Chat GPT for generating written responses to APBI361 assignments or for generating your written research papers, the use of online tools that help to generate the APA in-text citations and references section is not considered a breach of academic integrity for APBI361.</p>
<p><strong>Due Dates and Late Assignments</strong></p>
<p>All assignments are due at the times and dates listed in the course calendar. All times listed are set to Vancouver campus time (PST/PDT, UTC-7 hours). Students in different time zones will be responsible for converting to their own time/date to meet on time assignment deadlines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Course assignments and their scheduling are intended to support students’ learning with frequent, low stakes learning activities that build organizational and analytical skills and competencies. Timely completion of these low marks value assignments, including the group discussions is integral to the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Late Discussion Assignments</u></p>
<p>With acknowledgement of the health challenges we are all currently facing, final marks for the weekly discussion assignments will be calculated as the best 9 out of 10 submissions. <em>Specific marks reductions for late discussion assignments are noted within the discussion marking rubric.</em></p>
<p><u>Individual Project Proposals, Team Policy Assignments</u></p>
<p>Late marks reductions of 10% per day</p>
<p><u>Individual Project Assignment</u></p>
<p>Late marks reductions of 5% per day</p>
<p><u>Policies on requests for assignment due date extensions:</u></p>
<ol>
<li>No questions will be asked for 24-hour extension requests made due to illness, including academic stress related, when made with proactive communication at minimum 48 hours prior to deadline. Exceptions to this ‘grace period’ for assignment extension will be made at discretion of instructor if a student presents a repeating pattern of assignment extension requests without documentation. Specific procedures for communicating these requests will be noted in assignment instructions.</li>
<li><strong>No same day requests for extension will be granted without documentation</strong> (e.g. medical).</li>
<li>Following university-wide policies on accessibility and accommodation, students with letters of accommodations will be granted assignment extension requests based on their documentation.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Student Resources and Mental Health</strong></p>
<p>If you are having issues with stress, anxiety, or other mental health problems, please do not hesitate to contact the instructor and to reach out to the wide range of UBC resource persons who are focused on providing support in this arena.</p>

<p><strong>International Students</strong></p>
<p>The shift to online learning has greatly altered teaching and learning at UBC, including changes to health and safety considerations. Keep in mind that some UBC courses might cover topics that are censored or considered illegal by non-Canadian governments. This may include, but is not limited to, human rights, representative government, defamation, obscenity, gender, or sexuality, and historical or current geopolitical controversies. If you are a student living abroad, you will be subject to the laws of your local jurisdiction, and your local authorities might limit your access to course material or take punitive action against you. UBC is strongly committed to academic freedom, but has no control over foreign authorities (please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://academic.ubc.ca/about-vp-academic/academic-values/advancing-academic-freedom#:~:text=Academic%20freedom%20consists%20of%20%E2%80%9Cthe,UBC%20Senate%20Statement%2C%201976).">here</a><u>.</u>&nbsp;for an articulation of the values of the University conveyed in the Senate Statement on Academic Freedom). Thus, we recognize that students will have legitimate reason to exercise caution in studying and researching certain subjects. If you have concerns regarding your personal situation, consider postponing taking a course with manifest risks, until you are back on campus or reach out to your academic advisor to find substitute courses. For further information and support, please visit:&nbsp;http://academic.ubc.ca/support-resources/freedom-expression</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="_Toc2236271"></a><u>Additional University Policies</u></p>
<p>UBC provides resources to support student learning, and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise, and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions.</p>
<p>Details of the policies and how to access support are available<strong> </strong>on<strong> </strong><a href="https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success"><strong>the UBC Senate website</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
