<p><strong>Land Acknowledgement</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>UBC’s Point Grey Campus is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xwməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam) people. The land it is situated on has always been a place of learning for the Musqueam people, who for millennia have passed on their culture, history, and traditions from one generation to the next on this site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am grateful to be instructing this course focused on better understanding our relationships to agriculture and food systems from the land of the Musqueam people, and from the place where I also live and work as an uninvited guest and settler farmer that stands within the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territories of the <a href="https://native-land.ca/">Hul’qumi’num Treaty Group</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Course Instructor Brief Biographical Statement</strong></p>
<p>I am a teaching and research faculty member in the Applied Biology Program of the Faculty of Land and Food Systems with a part-time appointment. I have been instructing courses focused on Agroecology and Food Systems in our faculty since 2009. This course emerged from my graduate research, from my experience as a practicing farmer, and from the years as lead instructor for the UBC Farm Practicum in Sustainable Agriculture. My areas of research and farming practice are focused on soil health centered best practices with an agroecological lens. I am also a full-time farmer living and working my family’s 40-acre farm on Vancouver Island. My research collaborations with the Sustainable Agriculture Landscapes Lab and Dr. Sean Smukler connect our farm with a wider network of regionally focused on-farm investigations.</p>

<p><strong><u>Course Description</u></strong></p>
<p>APBI265</p>
<p>The question: <em>'How do we feed the world'</em> dominated the restructuring of agricultural policy and farming landscapes in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century towards the singular aim of increased production and continues to drive much of the debate around farming and food systems today. This course is built on a foundation of the science, practice, and social movements of Agroecology, and provides a critical evaluation of the ‘feed the world’ approach. With student-centered and team-based learning, we explore emerging questions framed by contemporary Agroecologists, including: '<em>how do we feed ourselves'</em> and '<em>how do we make meaningful change to farming and food system</em>s' with a view towards greater equity, diversity, and inclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>APBI265 introduces Agroecology as an approach to redesigning agriculture and food systems.</p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Agroecology offers a set of practices,&nbsp;built on a foundation of science, energized by social movements that can move us towards sustainable agriculture and food systems in the 21st century.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The course goal is to facilitate a broad introduction to Agroecology as a model for transforming agriculture and food systems for the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Course Structure</u></strong></p>
<p>Pending any further changes to Public Health orders and university-wide operational changes, for this term (2022W2) APBI265 will be delivered as a an in-person course with regularly scheduled on campus classroom sessions. These classroom sessions will be structured to include a plenary / brief lecture &amp; learning activities overview, large group discussion, and team-based discussion and project work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We will meet in Frank Forward (FORW) building, room 317 from 1 pm - 4 pm</strong> Wednesdays unless otherwise notified.</p>
<p><a href="https://learningspaces.ubc.ca/classrooms/forw-317">https://learningspaces.ubc.ca/classrooms/forw-317</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building communication skills and continued practice with collaborative and social learning are important learning objectives of the course and will require flexibility and coordination of your schedule. You will be asked to regularly contribute to discussions, to respectfully engage, provide peer review and feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In pursuit of directly engaging with agriculture and food systems challenges, students enrolled in APBI265 will be responsible for taking the initiative to communicate safely in person and/or virtually with their peers, with practicing farmers, food systems activists, and with their instructor as key activities and connections to course learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Course readings and all assignments will all be located within and submitted to the APBI265 Canvas course website. Students will need to familiarize themselves with how to navigate the site, where and how to submit each assignment, and take responsibility for communicating regularly with classmates and the instructor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Learning Materials</u></strong></p>
<p>All learning materials for this course will be provided on the Canvas course website. No additional textbook or other purchases required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Course Schedule</u></strong></p>
<p>The schedule for the course will be organized on a weekly basis, with scheduled classroom sessions held on Wednesdays, team-based <span>assignments,</span> and quick-write session reports also due on Wednesdays. Larger marks value written assignments will be due on Fridays --with the exception of the final individual project assignment due on the last teaching day of the term, Thursday, April 13).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A detailed weekly course schedule can be found on the APBI265 home page in Canvas.</p>

<p><strong>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>What is academic integrity?</u></strong></p>
<p>The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This working definition of ‘academic integrity’ was created by Dr. Catherine Rawn, was suggested by the Centre for Teaching and Learning at UBC and carries a Creative Commons license.</p>
<p>Much of the written work in this course that is an “Introduction to Sustainable Food Systems” will rely on your individual reflections and on the exercise of writing as critical thinking. We will be using the Turnitin tool to collect and review written assignments in APBI265.</p>
<p>To help you learn your responsibilities as a student in this course, please read and understand UBC’s expectations for academic honesty in the UBC Calendar: “<a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,286,0,0">Academic Honesty</a>,” “<a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,959">Academic Misconduct</a>,” and “<a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,960">Disciplinary Measures</a>,”. Read and reflect on the<a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,285,0,0"> Student Declaration and Responsibility</a>.</p>
<p><strong><u>Where can I find support to meet these expectations?</u></strong></p>
<p>There are resources to help you meet these expectations, for example the Chapman Learning Commons<a href="http://learningcommons.ubc.ca/resource-guides/avoid-plagiarism/"> "Understand Academic Integrity"</a>.&nbsp;For written assignments and help with plagiarism and citation, see the <a href="https://writing.library.ubc.ca/?login">Centre for Writing and Scholarly Communication</a>.</p>
<p>Additional resources for learning with integrity can be found on the UBC <a href="academicintegrity.ubc.ca">Academic Integrity Website</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Please reach out to me with any questions you may have about this</strong>, either informally after our classroom sessions, with a request for scheduling an office meeting, or with questions and responses that can be shared with all students on our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) discussion board.</p>
<p><u>Final notes and examples to help identify when Academic Integrity is violated</u></p>
<p>All students are subject to the University's&nbsp;rules&nbsp;on <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,959">Academic Misconduct</a> and have a responsibility at all times to behave according to the standards of integrity that are required of all members of the academic community.</p>
<p>Plagiarism is a serious offence and any student caught plagiarizing will be subject to penalties set out in the&nbsp;UBC calendar. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copying or paraphrasing from another author or source without proper citation</li>
<li>Copying work from another student</li>
<li>Copying your own work used for another course without clear acknowledgement and rationale</li>
<li>The use of Chat GPT and similar online resources that generate text responses or research papers in substitution for your own reflections and original writing</li>
<li><a href="https://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0">https://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0</a></li>
<li>Broadly, any form of intellectual theft where <em>‘another's’</em> (inclusive of AI) work or ideas are presented as another individual's assignment</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Academic Integrity and written acknowledgement of learning resources in APBI265</strong></p>
<p>The accepted citation-acknowledgement format for all written assignments in APBI265 is the American Psychological Association (APA) format.&nbsp;<u>You are expected to follow this format for all written assignments. </u></p>
<p><u>Specific examples for citation and acknowledgement of a slightly modified APA format within Discussion Assignments are provided in the Discussion Assignment Guidelines (</u>Week 1 Learning Module)<u>.</u></p>
<p>In brief, the APA writing style aims to promote objectivity in communicating science, and the APA format is a means to standardize reports across the scientific community (Schwartz, Landrum, &amp; Guring, 2013). More detailed information about this format, including how to cite references correctly can be found&nbsp;here <a href="https://guides.library.ubc.ca/apacitationstyle">https://guides.library.ubc.ca/apacitationstyle</a> and&nbsp;here<u> </u><a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html">https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html</a></p>
<p>In contrast to the use of the Chat GPT for generating written responses to APBI265 assignments or for generating your written research papers, the use of online tools that help to generate the APA in-text citations and references section is not considered a breach of academic integrity for APBI265.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Due Dates and Late Assignments</strong></p>
<p>All assignments are due at the times and dates listed in the course calendar. All times listed are set to Vancouver campus time (PST/PDT, UTC-7 hours). Students in different time zones will be responsible for converting to their own time/date to meet on time assignment deadlines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Course assignments and their scheduling are intended to support students’ learning with frequent, low stakes learning activities that build organizational and analytical skills and competencies. Timely completion of these low marks value assignments and proposals is integral to the process.</p>
<p><strong><u>Late or missed ‘Quick-write’ Session Reports </u></strong></p>
<p>With acknowledgement of the health challenges we are all currently facing, final marks for these weekly written assignments will be calculated as the best 9 out of 10 submissions.</p>
<p>These ‘quick-write’ assignments are intended in part to capture the value of your attendance and participation with each of the classroom sessions towards meeting overall course learning objectives. Importantly, this includes the practice and presence with team-based discussion, presentations, and project work. Time within the classroom session will be designated for the completion of these session reports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you miss more than one of the classroom sessions (see notes on best 9/10 marks above) you will need to provide documented medical or other evidence or simply lose a portion (20%) of the marks for the session report you’ve submitted for that absence.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Late marks deductions are 20% per day for Session Report assignments.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Individual Project Proposals, Team Project Proposals</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Late marks reductions of 10% per day</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Individual Project Report, Team Project Report</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Late marks reductions of 5% per day</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Team presentations</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Except in the case of an emergency, must be presented on the day scheduled. </strong></p>
<p>Personal emergencies or illness faced by members of the team presenting on a given day will be handled on a case-by-case basis with communication between instructor and team members.</p>
<p><u>Policies on requests for assignment due date extensions:</u></p>
<ol>
<li><em><span>Except for</span> the ‘Quick-Write’ Session Report assignments as noted above</em>, no questions will be asked for 24-hour extension requests to proposal and project report assignments if made due to illness, <u>when made with proactive communication at minimum 48 hours prior to deadline</u>. Exceptions to this ‘grace period’ for assignment extension will be made at discretion of instructor if a student presents a repeating pattern of assignment extension requests without documentation.</li>
<li><strong>No same day requests for extension will be granted without documentation</strong> (e.g. medical).</li>
<li>Following university-wide policies on accessibility and accommodation, students with letters of accommodations will be granted assignment extension requests based on their documentation.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Student Resources and Mental Health</strong></p>
<p>If you are having issues with stress, anxiety, or other mental health problems, please do not hesitate to contact the instructor and to reach out to the wide range of UBC resource persons who are focused on providing support in this arena.</p>

<p><strong>International Students</strong></p>
<p>The shift to online learning has greatly altered teaching and learning at UBC, including changes to health and safety considerations. Keep in mind that some UBC courses might cover topics that are censored or considered illegal by non-Canadian governments. This may include, but is not limited to, human rights, representative government, defamation, obscenity, gender, or sexuality, and historical or current geopolitical controversies. If you are a student living abroad, you will be subject to the laws of your local jurisdiction, and your local authorities might limit your access to course material or take punitive action against you. UBC is strongly committed to academic freedom, but has no control over foreign authorities (please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://academic.ubc.ca/about-vp-academic/academic-values/advancing-academic-freedom#:~:text=Academic%20freedom%20consists%20of%20%E2%80%9Cthe,UBC%20Senate%20Statement%2C%201976).">here</a><u>.</u>&nbsp;for an articulation of the values of the University conveyed in the Senate Statement on Academic Freedom). Thus, we recognize that students will have legitimate reason to exercise caution in studying and researching certain subjects. If you have concerns regarding your personal situation, consider postponing taking a course with manifest risks, until you are back on campus or reach out to your academic advisor to find substitute courses. For further information and support, please visit:&nbsp;http://academic.ubc.ca/support-resources/freedom-expression</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="_Toc2236271"></a><u>Additional University Policies</u></p>
<p>UBC provides resources to support student learning, and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise, and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions.</p>
