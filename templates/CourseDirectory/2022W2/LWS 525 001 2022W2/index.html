<p>Winter Term 2&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credits: 3&nbsp;</p>
<p>Class:&nbsp;Tues/Thurs 9:30 – 11:00&nbsp;am</p>
<p>Room: MCML 258 (in-person)</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The course provides a comprehensive overview of water basins and their vital role in shaping the world and the need for watershed management by integrating concepts and approaches from environmental sciences, resource management, and policy. As climate change and population growth have had significant and diverse impacts on major river drainage basins around the world, students will explore how the management of freshwater (the vital, and often “fugitive” resource), is evolving through an era of increased uncertainty.</p>
<p>Principles of systems thinking and analysis and integrated watershed science and management are applied in LWS 525 in the context of drainage basins, including transboundary river systems and where cumulative effects and water management and governance become more complex and significant.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites and/or Co-requisites</h3>
<p>Must be a graduate student enrolled in the MLWS or Soil Science programs. Other graduate or upper-level undergraduate students, from similar programs at UBC, may take the course with permission from the instructors and, if deemed beneficial, an interview.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Course Structure</h3>
<p>LWS/SOIL 525 is a lecture and discussion format offering.</p>
<p>Slides, required readings and assignments will be posted in Canvas (<a href="http://www.canvas.ubc.ca/">www.canvas.ubc.ca</a>). Please check Canvas regularly. Canvas information will be the most updated information.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;Learning objectives</h3>
<ol>
<li>To understand the definition and components of a Water Basin- geographical delineation, components and their functions, integration, and nomenclature,&nbsp;</li>
<li>Provide a historical framework of the vital role provided by water basins, culturally and historically, and the legacy that shaped the interaction between water and human evolution in relation to land and water relationships,</li>
<li>Identify and discuss the interconnections between water resource management, ecosystem goods and services, and human and ecosystem health,</li>
<li>To identify and evaluate the effects of human activities - agriculture, forestry, industry and urbanization - on the sustainability of the land-water systems, as a result of individual sectors and their cumulative effects,</li>
<li>To identify and discuss water governance and water as a human right. To evaluate its implications in the Canadian and international context.</li>
<li>To identify some of the main drainage basin challenges: dams, diversions, extractions, contamination and pollution.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Additional information</h3>
<p><strong>COVID-19 in the Classroom&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>It is important that all of us feel as comfortable as possible engaging in-class activities while sharing an indoor space. Although not required nor mandatory, it is recommended that you use non-medical masks that cover your nose and mouth making it harder for the spread of COVID-19 and the seasonal flu. Please wear a non-medical mask during our class meetings, for your protection, and the safety and comfort of everyone else in the class. Please refrain from eating in class. If you need to drink water/coffee/tea/etc., please keep your mask on between sips. There may be students who have medical reasons for not wearing a mask. Please maintain a respectful environment. UBC Respectful Environment Statement [<u>https://hr.ubc.ca/working-ubc/respectful-environment&nbsp;Links to an external site.</u>]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we will not have a rigid seating plan, you are encouraged to sit in the same area each time you come to the classroom. MCML 258 has a larger seating capacity than the number of students registered for the LWS/SOIL 525 course, allowing extra space between you and your classmates. To increase ventilation in the room, we may open windows and doors, so please dress appropriately (i.e., wear a sweater on cold days).</p>
<p>&nbsp;What if I cannot attend in person to class?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Various circumstances may lead to a student being unable to attend classes for a temporary period of time. For example:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>They may not be able to get to Vancouver in time for the start of the course;&nbsp;</li>
<li>They may be isolating after arrival / feeling unwell at some point in the course;&nbsp;</li>
<li>They may have different travel restrictions or regional health orders.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Please do not worry if you find you cannot attend class in person. All course materials will be available to students via Canvas. Presentation slides and readings will be posted within the Canvas course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: If you are feeling unwell, please DO NOT come to class. This is to protect the health and safety of all students, staff and faculty at UBC. Please email the instructor(s) before the class to inform us if you are unable to attend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can download UBC Safe Vancouver App to conduct a daily health assessment before using public and shared spaces on campus. For more information, and to download the app, visit the UBC Safety &amp; Risk Services website [https://srs.ubc.ca/health-safety/ubc-safe-vancouver-app<strong>]&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Academic Integrity</strong></p>
<p>The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.</p>
