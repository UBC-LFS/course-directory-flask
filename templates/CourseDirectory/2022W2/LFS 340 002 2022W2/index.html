<p><strong>LEARNING ACTIVITIES</strong></p>
<p>Some self-directed outdoor classroom activities may require small group work; assigned reading must be completed before class meetings. In addition, you should submit any discussion questions before the meeting. There will be one or two flexible learning sessions, no class meeting, where students must complete an outdoor assignment and report to the class later. Depending on COVID-19 restrictions and weather conditions, we will organize class meetings at the UBC farm Indigenous garden. Class participation is graded, expected, and highly encouraged.</p>
<p><strong>LEARNING MATERIALS</strong></p>
<p>There is no required textbook for this course; links to assigned reading material will be available with each module posted on Canvas. Canvas will be used as the central online learning management system. You may be asked to visit or directed to other online resources if necessary.</p>

<p><strong>ASSIGNMENT DETAILS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Academic and Self-Reflective Postings</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The weekly posting should reflect your reflections on course content covered up to the previous session of the due date. The academic portion of the posting should be based on required readings, guest speakers (if applicable), videos and class content presented by your instructors. The self-reflective piece should demonstrate your personal growth from a significant experience (s). It is not a summary of other people's thoughts but your opinion, although you could also respond to other student's postings.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Out-of-Class Project (UBC Museum of Anthropology)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In a short essay format, describe your reflections and impressions of the exhibition, keeping the course's topics in mind. The self-reflective portion should demonstrate your personal growth from significant experiences. It is not a summary of other people's thoughts or descriptions of the material describing the exhibit. Still, your opinion and feelings, and gained an understanding of the impact of colonization and dispossession of Indigenous people's cultures through your visit to the UBC Museum of Anthropology (MOA).</p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Story Analysis and Cultural Identity Essay</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Based on a selected Indigenous story, write a 1200-word response that demonstrates and supports your answer to the story by linking other ideas and concepts, describing opinions and emotions to the story's message, generating conclusions using analyses and evidence, and suggesting contextual connections and relationships. Reflective writing is more personal than other types of academic writing; think mindfully about the message offered in the story, what it means to you, and the process of learning or practicing in your professional career.</p>
<p>Try to identify literary devices such as allusion and metaphor and explain their purpose in the story. Make connections, interpret, and draw conclusions about Indigenous worldviews. Discuss any ethical implications, issues, or conflicts in the story's title. How does it relate to the topics addressed in the course? Would you tell the story from a different perspective? Does the story relate to your own experience or culture? What are the teachings embedded in the story? Was there any message conveyed about Indigenous knowledge? How is the message communicated? Why did you choose the video for your assignment? Do you feel sympathy or empathy for the characters?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Journal Log Response (4 entries)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Each student will keep a journal of the course. The complete <strong>journals</strong> are due at the end of the term. The journal may be any notebook where papers are already attached, or you may attach loose documents—writing about ideas relevant to the class/topic/course. A large part of your journal grade will depend on whether you create a synthesis of the course information. If references are made, you must cite them properly. No two people in the class should have the same story written in their journals.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Participation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Your enthusiasm, involvement, and active participation affect the quality of class discussion and contributions to the online forum and learning environment,&nbsp; and it will include in your total participation. We strive to create a supportive environment for the students. Take this opportunity to share your thoughts and knowledge. It will help you build confidence and prepare you for future professions.</p>
