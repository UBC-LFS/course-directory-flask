<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Many of you are taking this course out of your own interest in nutrition, but may be asking&nbsp;<em>what is applied public health nutrition?&nbsp;</em>As current and future leaders in promoting health through nutrition, it is important to understand the impact you can have on populations and groups by using scientific evidence to inform policy, programs, evaluation and research.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: #169179; font-size: 18pt;">Applied public health nutrition</span></strong>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 14pt;">is the application of food and nutrition knowledge, policy, and research to improve the health of populations.
