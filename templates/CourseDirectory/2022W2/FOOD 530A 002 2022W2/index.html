<p><strong>Lettuce deterioration and shelf life studies: A closer look at enzymatic and microbial deterioration and prevention</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Project Description:</strong></p>
<p>Enzymatic and microbial activities are the main causes of food deterioration leading to food wastage.</p>
<p>The project provides a comprehensive look at the deterioration of fresh-cut ready-to-eat Romaine lettuce and speculates ways to extend the shelf life. There are two parts to this project. In part 1, there are two tasks which will be undertaken by two different students. In part 2, students will work collaboratively to conduct a 30-minute presentation on their findings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This project has two parts:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Part 1: Literature review</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Task 1-Individual</strong></p>
<p>Do a literature review on the browning of Romaine lettuce. You may have heard about Arctic apples® (Alvarez et al., 2021). Based on your research conclude if the same procedure can be applied to Lettuce.</p>
<p>In your report, you should consider the following points (please note that this is not an exclusive list – you are expected to develop your outline for the report):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe the extent of food waste in Canada and more specifically lettuce wastage</li>
<li>Describe the enzymatic browning mechanism in Lettuce and compare it to apples</li>
<li>Describe the development of Arctic apples and if the same procedure can be applied to lettuce
<ul>
<li>What information is still required?</li>
<li>What might be the barriers?</li>
<li>How these barriers can be overcome?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consider the safety issues associated with the new product.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Task 2-Individual</strong></p>
<p>Do a literature review on the microbial spoilage of Romaine lettuce and current packaging technology.</p>
<p>Based on your research conclude what are the shortcomings of these common packaging systems.</p>
<p>In your report, you should consider the following points (please note that this is not an exclusive list – you are expected to develop your outline for the report):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe the extent of food waste in Canada and more specifically lettuce wastage</li>
<li>Describe the microbial spoilage in lettuce, including the growth requirements of spoilage formers associated with lettuce.</li>
<li>Provide information on the current activities to reduce microbial spoilage in organic and regular lettuce:
<ul>
<li>Define organic food (lettuce).</li>
<li>Describe active and smart packaging.</li>
<li>What information is currently available?</li>
<li>What are some of the barriers associated with the process?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consider the safety issues associated with the processing and packaging of fresh-cut Romaine lettuce.</li>
</ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Part 2. Collaborative work</strong></p>
<p>As you have noticed the first item in your projects is the same. You are encouraged to work together collaboratively to conduct the literature review on food wastage in Canada as it pertains to lettuce.</p>
<p>You will work collaboratively at the end to provide a 30-minute presentation on your finding.</p>
<p>Your final grade will be evaluated based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Active participation in weekly meetings 10%</li>
<li>Term paper 55%</li>
<li>Teamwork 15 %</li>
<li>Presentation 20%</li>
</ul>
<p>A detailed rubric will be provided for each assessment item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Course expectations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Student should attend the 1-2 hours of weekly meetings with the instructors.</li>
<li>In the first session the project will be described and students should work on their project and provide weekly report on their activities and progress.</li>
<li>Student should provide a time line for completing the project and identify the milestones</li>
<li>A canvas platform will be provided to post the weekly reports and used as communication means.</li>
<li>The team activity part will be assessed by the individual report on the team interactions and team contract.</li>
</ul>
