<p><strong>Course Objective</strong></p>
<p>This course addresses advanced aspects of food processing concepts and technology and is intended as a transition course for graduate students. In addition, this course provides students with hands-on experience in the fundamental operations and principles employed in the food industry: <strong>thermal processing</strong>, <strong>food freezing, </strong><strong>food dehydration,</strong><strong> size-reduction/homogenization/encapsulation, and novel processing technologies</strong>. It is expected that students registering in this course have some pre-requisite knowledge of food processing, while some preliminary knowledge is provided through pre-recorded and transcribed lectures. The course builds up on that knowledge to equip the learners with advanced information as well as hands-on-training on cutting-edge food processing equipment.</p>
<p>Group work is one of the core tenet of this course. Students are pre-assigned to work in groups of 5 students to complete these <strong>3 laboratory modules</strong> by conducting experiments, collecting data, analyzing the results, and submitting a report at the end of each module. Students also work in groups to deliver group lectures on advances in various food processing approaches, as well as submit a term paper that will highlight the recent developments in the last 5 years and future outlook.</p>
<p>By the end of this course, students should be able to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Describe </strong>the science (mechanism of action), history, importance, benefits and disadvantages of various processing approaches commonly applied in food industry.</li>
<li><strong>Select </strong>appropriate mathematical models and <strong>Calculate</strong> important food processing parameters in order to <strong>Design</strong> an industrial food process.</li>
<li><strong>Employ </strong>a suitable dehydration/freezing process for increasing the shelf-life of a food product.</li>
<li><strong>Recognize </strong>emerging technologies and concepts in food process science.</li>
<li><strong>Know </strong>where to look and how to find information about food process science and engineering principle, design and equipment.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Checklist for Course Preparation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Read the Pre-Reading Material and come prepared to class.</li>
<li>Bring a smartphone or computer to all classes.</li>

<li>Each Module shall end with a 30-min in-class Post-Assessment Quiz (In-class) on the topics covered, <strong>each post-assessment quiz having 8% weightage</strong> in the course.</li>
<li>The scores in all pre- and post-assessment quizzes combined will contribute to <strong>50% weightage in the overall course grade</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Group Work (50%: 30% lab module reports, 5% presentation, 10% term paper, 5% group evaluation).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Group Signup &amp; Topic Selection:</strong> Including the group labs, 50% weightage in the course will be given to Group Activities. 6 Groups have been pre-assigned, each with 5 members. Each group will submit 3 choices in order of preference for their Group Topic from one of the five lecture modules or the optional module. Instructor will assign the group topics on a first-come, first-serve basis.</li>
<li><strong>Group Lab Reports:</strong> There will be <strong>3 lab module reports (each with 10% weightage in the overall course grade) </strong>due at the end of each lab-module, which must be uploaded in a pdf format by 5 pm as per dates highlighted in the Course Summary on Canvas. Each group is responsible to hand in only one copy of the report. A 10% per day late penalty will be applied to any late submission. Each report has specific requirements and criteria. Please read the instructions carefully at the end of each lab exercise. Observation of general laboratory rules and good lab practices is worth 10% marks for every lab session.</li>
<li><strong>Group Presentation: </strong>Each group will deliver a 30-minute group lecture on recent advances in the field of the topic selected<strong>, having 5% weightage in the overall course grade</strong>. The presentations will be graded equally on the following rubric: a) quality of the delivery; b) ability to explain the concepts to other students; c) extent of information covered on the proposed topic; d) ability to answers questions and doubts from other students; e) quality of the ppt file submitted. Final lecture presentation must be uploaded as a .ppt/.pptx file on Canvas before 5pm<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> on the day of </span>lecture<span style="font-size: 1rem;">. The presentations will be made available to other students via Canvas for self-study for post-assessment quizzes.</span></li>
<li><strong><strong>Group Term Paper: </strong></strong>Before the end of the course, each group will submit a term paper on the same topic as they made their group presentation, which will have <strong>10% weightage in the overall course grade</strong>. The term paper should be about 8-10 type-written pages (Single 1.0 line spacing, Times New Roman, 12 pt font size) in length (excluding the references) and must include a 5-year SYSTEMATIC literature review on the topic and a critical analysis of the future directions and current approaches. The topic should be divided into major sub-headings to facilitate easy reading and understanding of the concept. Focus must be on generating original illustrations, figures and tables, with appropriate permissions from the source included in case of using their figure/tables. In the end, give full details of all citations (references) included in the text. The term paper will be graded equally on the following rubric: a) adherence to scientific writing fundamentals; b) extent of the literature review conducted; c) critical analysis of the literature; d) future outlook and conclusions presented and e) peer-evaluation. Term paper must be submitted before the last day of the class as a .doc/docx<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> file on Canvas.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>Group Peer Evaluation (5%):</strong> Each group member will rate other members on a scale of 0 to 5. Points recieved by each group member from their groupmates will have <strong>5% weightage in the overall course grade</strong>. This makes group collaboration extremely critical.</span></li>
