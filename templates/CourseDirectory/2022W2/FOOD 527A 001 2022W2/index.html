<p><strong>Advanced Food Safety Laboratory <br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Alberto Mendoza-Galina</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Background and Rationale </strong></p>
<p>Currently, the food industry has been under pressure to improve its food safety and food quality management systems, not only from the regulatory point of view but also from the perspective of food markets and customers alike.</p>
<p>Today food manufacturing facilities, food handling sites, food importers, food packaging facilities, food transportation services, warehouses, and distribution centers must have a demonstrable and evaluable food safety and food quality management system. A good number of our students have already been engaged in working within this framework during their summer practicum project (FOOD 531), which is fundamental to the student’s academic and professional formation.</p>
<p>The MFS cohorts are comprised of committed and high-performing students, with excellent academic achievements, but with very limited professional working experience.&nbsp; The course will be using actual industry scenarios, placing the students at the forefront of the real-life problems the food industry is facing today. Our graduates are commonly working in R&amp;D, QA/QC, and GFSI/HACCP, and this course will pave their road with the practice necessary to gain the experience and confidence to successfully deal with the food industry's contemporary challenges.</p>
<p>A quick look at the recall data will show that even when there is greater surveillance, and higher food safety standards are applied, product contamination is still present. &nbsp;Furthermore, pathogens once believed to be product-specific have become pervasive and ubiquitous to all food products from different types of processes and manufacturing environments.</p>
<p>Technology as a tool has evolved remarkably in the last decades enhancing the capacity to detect/monitor faster and more accurately than ever before. However, the most efficient tool for food safety professionals is their approach when evaluating hazards based on risk assessment and translating them into preventive outcomes, validated and measurable, monitored and evaluated for efficiency. This is paramount for the proper development and implementation of any science-based food safety and food quality plan.</p>
<p>This course is formative and hands-on, where students will apply actual industry methods and learn by developing preventive and or corrective measures based on science to manage resources necessary to attain positive food safety outcomes. It also observes the new regulations in the US and Canada; Food Safety and Modernization Act (FSMA), and Food Safety for Canadians Act, respectively. Both acts anticipate stronger requirements for importers of food products/ingredients (suppliers), labeling, traceability, pathogen control, and monitoring. This will include hands-on Global Food Safety Initiative/ Quality Assurance (GFSI/QA) managerial and Preventive Controls Qualified Individual (PCQI) roles.</p>
<p><strong>Goal </strong></p>
<p>To actively engage students in evaluating real industry events, designing strategies, and providing solutions to food industry scenarios like cases of product contamination, equipment contamination, class 1 food recalls including products, label misinformation regarding allergens, raw materials, packaging, and processing aids, and document traceability.</p>
<p>The industry scenarios will be chosen from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recalls and foodborne outbreak reports. Recalls are related to allergen labeling, followed by pathogen contamination and other physical and chemical hazards. From the presented scenarios students will learn the legal and monetary repercussions of these cases and each case will be studied/researched to design/develop corrective actions and preventive measures that would have controlled or eliminated the hazards.</p>
<p>Each case study will allow students to design and document environmental monitoring programs for pathogens (e.g. <em>Listeria </em>spp, <em>Salmonella </em>spp) and propose plans for evaluating cleaning and sanitation efficiency (i.e. visual inspections, microbiological testing with relevant microorganisms, protein assays for allergen monitoring, and ATP (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate"><span>Adenosine triphosphate</span></a>) swabbing), product development, label compliance, regulatory compliance to the country of final product destination, developing traceability plans, education, and training of employees based on the site’s food safety plan, among other examples.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Working with these scenarios to produce solutions will exercise the student’s critical thinking, teamwork, and risk-based hazard analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Tools and skills that students will practice: </strong></p>
<p>This course will provide students with hands-on experience in food safety risk assessment and implementation of preventive controls in industrial settings. The tools and skills that students will practice include:<strong>- </strong>Hazard analysis and risk assessment (likelihood and severity, justified by science, regulatory guidelines, foodborne outbreaks, recall statistics, CDC foodborne outbreaks investigations, industry practices, or model experimentation/validation).</p>
<p>- Microbiological risk assessment based on the type of product and process.</p>
<p>-CDC emerging microorganisms and parasites in food.</p>
<p>- Preventive Controls for Human Food (PCHF), PCHF food safety plans to comply with the US FDA, FSMA, and the new Food Safety for Canadians Act (FSCA)</p>
<p>During the evaluation of real case scenarios, students will learn how to conduct root cause analysis with preventive outcomes. The above are also required skills for any GFSI professional.</p>
<p><strong>Required courses:</strong>&nbsp; Food Sciences/Technology/Processing.</p>
<p><strong>Intersectionality:</strong> Food Legislation, Toxicology and Food Microbiology, HACCP, Food Safety.</p>

<p><strong>Course dynamic </strong></p>
<p>This course is student-driven. The class is mainly the environment where we will apply what was read and understood in solving food industry real-case scenarios. Every class will start with a short introduction led by the instructor &nbsp;(15-30 minutes) to review important concepts.</p>
<p>Students will read weekly topics (mainly recall/Foodborne reports and contextual information) and write summaries in their class logbooks. Applying hazard analysis and risk assessment students will present in class the solutions found during their investigation. Students will perform this on their own time before class.</p>
<p>Real case scenarios will be discussed in class and as a group, a set of conclusions will be reached, 90 minutes for discussion and individual participation, 30 minutes for conclusions, and a review of outcomes.</p>
<p>Assigned student groups will work outside of class as teams to evaluate and propose documented solutions to the cases assigned to them. Two class presentations in total with two group papers. The class presentation will be evaluated for completeness and clarity. The group papers will be evaluated for form, depth, solution found to their assigned case, and references (minimum 10)</p>
<p>There are 5 individual written assignments during the course. Papers will be evaluated for form, completeness, and references (minimum 6).</p>
<p>The final exam is composed of open questions, multiple-choice and case scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Course evaluation, TBD this is an example, we will discuss and reach an agreement in class<br></strong></p>
