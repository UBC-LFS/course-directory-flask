<p>Welcome to FRE 521E Supply Chains in Food and Agriculture: Economic Analysis and Technological Transformations&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am really looking forward to this course. Supply chains are receiving a lot of attention these days in the news â€” here's a <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://news.unl.edu/newsrooms/today/article/supply-chain-crunches-affecting-agriculture-from-farm-to-table/" target="_blank">link</a> to one example. Academics are also taking notice. As David Zilberman, one of my former professors at Berkeley said in a recent <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://blogs.berkeley.edu/2022/12/20/my-annual-review-2022/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, "... <span>innovations are implemented through supply chains. Whoever designs a supply chain might establish institutions like markets, contracts, and other arrangements for trading. So, if you want to address problems like climate change, which will require drastic technological changes, you need to stimulate innovation that will be upscaled and propagated by supply chains." One of David's very recent <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20201539" target="_blank">papers</a> provides an overview of the development of agri-food value chains and serves as the background reading for this course.&nbsp;</span></p>
