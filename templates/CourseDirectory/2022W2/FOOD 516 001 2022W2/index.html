<p><br>COURSE BACKGROUND</p>
<p><span>Currently, the food industry in the world and in Canada is undergoing a rapid upgrade of its food safety and food quality management systems, these new enhancements are customer-driven and based on global food safety standards as set forth by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) certified schemes. Food industries that embrace any of the GFSI schemes need to implement and pass a third-party audit to evaluate compliance, if the company is successful then it is certified.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Attaining global certification and maintaining these high expectation levels are now a requirement for doing business. As a food safety and food quality professional having a good set of skills and a strong knowledge base on the GFSI systems is not only necessary but in today’s employment market a unique advantage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Professionals in the food industry are catching up to these new systems, but currently, the courses available to them are at best a descriptive overview of the GFSI scheme codes, lacking tools for adequate interpretation and application of the requirements of the code into procedures and systems that are industry and product-specific, moreover, that can be translated into products that are safe and quality compliant.</span></p>
<p><span>Major retailers like Wal-Mart, COSTCO, Loblaw’s, Sobey’s, and Safeway, are now requiring their food suppliers to be GFSI certified, and this trend continues to increase.</span></p>
<p><span>GFSI schemes are CODEX HACCP based and this methodology is used both to design and develop the food safety and the food quality management system as well as GMPs and pre-requisite programs, therefore manufacturing or food-handling sites are responsible for making its product, process, and plant-specific. This is not an easy task, students learning these skills will be definitely at the forefront of the industry, from CEO, CFO, and other job positions, they all share some degree of responsibility under these total management systems.</span></p>
<p><span>This course is also informed by UN/FAO guidelines for food safety, European Union guidelines for food safety, The National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Food (NACMCF), CFIA and Safe Food for Canadians Act, SQFI auditing guidelines, and ISO 19011:2018 Guidelines for auditing management systems. The SQF Code is the most widely used in the food industry in North America.</span></p>

<p><br>COURSE INSTRUCTOR BIOGRAPHICAL STATEMENT [OPTIONAL]</p>
<p><span>UBC Land Food Systems, Food Science Master Program Alberto Mendoza-Galina, MA, BSc., Biochemist engineer.</span></p>
<p><span>GFSI Certified auditor, HACCP certified by the UN/FAO and the USDC/NMFS. I have more than 25 years of progressive experience in the areas of food safety and food quality management systems, my experience has been as a consultant, educator and certified auditor in diverse industry sectors, from primary production, slaughterhouses, food processing and manufacturing, to distribution centres and institutional food service establishments including, hotels, fast food and franchises in Canada, USA, Mexico and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I continued working in developing new food safety and food quality standards as part of the technical and auditing group at Merieux Nutrisciences Certification Services, with the Americas head office located in Chicago Il, USA, a company I have been working with for the past 14 years, I also worked developing the sanitary regulatory standards for food services for the tourism sector in Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am an expert in designing; validating and implementing tailored food safety and food quality management systems. My professional experience includes working with small family businesses up to large corporations, like McDonald's, Burger King, Subway, Costco, Wal-Mart, and YUM Brands (Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, A&amp;W) to name a few, closely working with their food and primary packaging suppliers. I have also worked in the nutritional supplements and natural products industry. I have expertise in hazard analysis, risk assessment, and risk management, particularly in dealing with manufacturing sites of high-risk RTE products.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am personally interested in local primary production versus industrial farming; minimizing the usage of additives in processed foods, and finding ways to produce foods in a sustainable community framework.</span></p>

<h1><br>OTHER INSTRUCTIONAL STAFF</h1>
<p><span>Every term I will have guest speakers, two GFSI auditors that will share their experiences, specifically their findings during auditing food manufacturing sites; and one to two additional speakers either from the food</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>industry or regulatory agencies. The food industry speakers usually talk about the quality and food safety challenges they encounter specifically in their processes and products, regulatory speakers deal with topics like how they carry out inspections, interpretation of the regulations, and so on. These are part of our course but will have no bearing on your scoring.</span></p>

<h1><br>COURSE STRUCTURE AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES</h1>
<p><span>Location: Room 30, FHN Building 2205 East Mall </span></p>
<p><span>This is an intensive student-driven course. Every week students will participate in making summaries, debating, and reaching conclusions for every topic of study that they have previously researched. The summaries will become the body of knowledge of the course and the exams.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Students will be compelled to work in groups to understand the steps to design and implement GMPs and PPs with a hazard analysis and risk assessment approach and conciliate their findings to the requirements of the SQF Code for specific food processes, and build up the guidelines to complete the implementation of these systems in case scenarios, writing policies, building programs, procedures, instructions, and records. This will provide insight into potential avenues to evaluate compliance during an audit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Students will be divided into groups and given assignments to perform a third-party audit of specific food facility case scenarios based on real industry experiences. Upon completion, students will write identifying the deviations observed against the code requirements and how these could be resolved. For every element of the code that is deemed compliant or non-compliant students will have to provide justification and evidence to support the scoring and findings.</span></p>
