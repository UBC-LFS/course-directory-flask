<p><strong>APBI 312 – Animal Reproduction Physiology</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Course Description:</em></strong></p>
<p>The course aims to provide a detailed description of the function and processes involved in reproductive physiology and current technologies in domesticated animals. The course will focus on physiological mechanisms related to puberty, reproductive cycle, fertilization, embryo development, pregnancy, parturition. Case scenarios of common problems related to domestic animals will be a key portion of this course.</p>
<p><strong><em>Learning Outcomes:</em></strong></p>
<p>This course should help students develop both the terminology needed to discuss problems associated with the reproduction physiology of domestic animals. In addition, students should understand the physiological basis for reproductive management practices and strategies to control reproductive processes and the application of current technologies in the different domestic animals.</p>

<p><strong><em>Academic Integrity:&nbsp; </em></strong></p>
<p>The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>GOOD LUCK!!!</p>
