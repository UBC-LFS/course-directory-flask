<p><strong>AQUA 507 (2 credits) Seafood Processing</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instructor: Alberto Mendoza</p>
<p>Email agalina@mail.ubc.ca</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Academic Calendar Entry</strong></p>
<p>Seafood Processing focuses on novel and traditional food processing methods and technologies used in B.C., and Canada. We will study CFIA regulations and GFSI food safety and quality management systems to attain aquaculture products' quality and safety compliance. The sustainability and environmental impacts of Seafood Processing are also reviewed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Course Format and Class Dynamic</strong></p>
<p>This course will be taught in the classroom. Every week chosen readings are assigned for students to read and study.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students will apply concepts and knowledge attained in the readings and in the classroom to identify food safety and food quality control points for specific seafood processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Real seafood process case scenarios would be reviewed to evaluate product safety and product quality, allowing students to assess and define process controls, monitoring activities, verification procedures, corrective actions (root cause analysis), and record-keeping to maintain and properly manage safety and quality plans, that are both regulatory and customer specifications compliant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The course starts from a general view of the seafood industry in Canada, seafood chemistry followed by principles of seafood processing, and into the fundamentals for process controls for seafood products safety and quality compliance. The last third of the syllabus will cover specific seafood products quality and safety issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On week 12 we will have a field trip to a seafood processing facility and for our last class, we expect a visit of a guest lecturer from CFIA to talk about regulatory compliance and licensing of seafood processing facilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each week in this tentative syllabus represents a 2-hour class.</p>
