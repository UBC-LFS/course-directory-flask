<p><strong>Course Objectives </strong></p>
<p>Food processing, handling, and distribution are components of a complex, interdependent system. Therefore the evaluation of a food site’s environmental impact requires a systemic approach based on an understanding of regenerative sustainability and the nexus where food, water, energy, climate, and human activities meet.</p>
<p>In this course, students will learn what contributes to the overall environmental impact of the food industry and explore potential solutions, considering carbon and water footprints, pollution, waste, energy consumption, and potential for regenerative strategies. Students will also learn how to evaluate environmental performance indicators and develop and apply a continuous improvement environmental management system based on ISO 14001 2015, the international standard for environmental management systems.</p>
<p>This course prepares students to contribute to local sustainability initiatives and help food industries work towards their sustainability goals.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Calendar entry:</strong> Regenerative sustainability and the sustainability nexus; health and environmental impacts of the food industry; environmental performance indicators and management systems; approaches for enhancing sustainability in the food industry</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>By the end of the course, students will be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe the sustainability nexus and regenerative sustainability</li>
<li>Apply carbon footprint, ecological footprint, and water footprint concepts to the food industry as sustainability indicators</li>
<li>Identify common wastes and pollutants produced by different food industry sectors and their impacts on human health and the environment</li>
<li>Identify common technologies used in the food industry to reduce, recycle and minimize environmental impact</li>
<li>Situate Canada’s status and progress within global climate change and sustainability goals</li>
<li>Evaluate environmental performance indicators for specific food industries</li>
<li>Apply the ISO 14001, 2015 environmental standards to a specific food industry case</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Course Format</strong></p>
<p>This course will be student-driven and require self-directed strategies for one’s learning. Prior to class, students are expected to reflect upon the weekly readings, answer questions posed for each class, and prepare for class discussions. Students are encouraged to seek out other relevant literature and share their findings with the class. The instructor will serve as the course coordinator and begin classes with presentations to facilitate student participation. At the end of each class, students will co-produce a summary of the concepts discussed during the session.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Learning Resources</strong></p>
<p>UBC Library has a series of <a href="https://services.library.ubc.ca/user-guides/undergraduate-students/">undergraduate user guides</a> to support your learning.&nbsp; For the upcoming terms, their <a href="https://learningcommons.ubc.ca/resource-guides/online-learners/">Online Learning video tutorial</a> and UBC’s <a href="https://keeplearning.ubc.ca/">Keep Learning website</a> are helpful resources.</p>
<p><strong>Course Assessment </strong></p>
<p>Course assessments include a personal journal, a group presentation accompanied by a group presentation, and an individual final paper. Each student will maintain a journal throughout the course, submitting brief summaries of class readings prior to class based on answering questions posed by the professor. The final paper will be on a food processing sustainability issue of the student’s choice. The paper will be solution-focused, allowing students to propose sustainability improvements for the food industry or entirely new ideas for sustainable food systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Student learning will be evaluated as follows: To be agreed with the class</p>

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong></p>
<p>The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. All UBC students are expected to behave as honest and responsible members of an academic community.&nbsp; At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas, and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is the student's obligation to learn, understand and follow the standards for academic honesty. Students must be aware that standards at the University of British Columbia may be different from those in secondary schools or at other institutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Violations of academic integrity lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious actions are taken. Plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on an assignment, exam, or course. More serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Academic misconduct may result in a one-year suspension from the University and a notation of academic discipline on the student's record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://guides.library.ubc.ca/tutorial-lfs/citing/plagiarism">UBC library</a> has a useful Academic Integrity website that explains what plagiarism is and how to avoid it.&nbsp; If a student is in any doubt as to the standard of academic honesty in a particular course or assignment, then the student must consult with the instructor as soon as possible. A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,958">Academic Calendar</a><span>.</span>&nbsp; All coursework is required to be submitted to Turnitin.com for review.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>University Policies</strong></p>
<p>UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions.</p>
<p>Details of the policies and how to access support are available<strong> </strong>on<strong> </strong><a href="https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success"><strong>the UBC Senate website</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
