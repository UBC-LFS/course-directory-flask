<p><strong>APBI 410 – Applied Animal Health and Physiology</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Course Description:</em></strong></p>
<p>This course is intended primarily for students in degree programs in the Faculty of Land and Food Systems (Applied Biology and Nutrition) and the Faculty of Science (Biology or Whole Animal Biology), who wish to increase their understanding of basic and applied physiological processes related to common disorders in production and companion animals. The primary objective of the course is to focus on knowledge application, interventions, and case studies. The course is expected to integrate different areas (physiology, biochemistry, pathology, pharmacology) using a combination of traditional classes and problem-based learning, using case scenarios that highlight the current application of knowledge.</p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Learning Outcomes:</em></strong></p>
<p>Upon completion of the course, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interpret pathological mechanisms that govern disease processes (cell injury, inflammation, immunity, neoplasia, vascular disturbances).</li>
<li>Evaluate processes related to infectious and metabolic diseases.</li>
<li>Understand the clinical and sub-clinical manifestations of pathological processes through molecular, physiological and morphological changes.</li>
<li>Critically assess and present case studies which investigate pathological conditions and treatment mechanisms.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Textbook, Primary Literature: </em></strong></p>
<p>Principles of Animal Physiology. Moyes &amp; Shulte, 3<sup>rd</sup> edition (Pearson).</p>
<p>There are no required textbooks for this course. All assigned readings will be taken from the primary literature (i.e. journal articles) and will be directly available through Canvas. Peer-reviewed reference materials can also be used to provide background information in areas such as physiology, and pathophysiological processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Laboratory – Case study sessions:</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Teaching Assistants – Sydney Moore (</em><span><a href="mailto:smoore12@mail.ubc.ca"><em>smoore12@mail.ubc.ca</em></a></span><em>), Rodrigo Conceicao (</em><span><a href="mailto:rckrebs@student.ubc.ca"><em>rckrebs@student.ubc.ca</em></a></span><em>), and Jessica Marques (<a href="mailto:jessica.dossantosmarques@ubc.ca" target="_blank">jessica.dossantosmarques@ubc.ca</a>) &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Testing and Computation:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>30% Quizzes and case studies (every other Thursday)</li>
<li>30% Presentations (Final two weeks)</li>
<li>40% Final exam&nbsp; (TBD)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Quizzes and case studies (30%)</em></p>
<p>The quizzes will be held every other Thursday and will be composed of short answer and essay questions related to the previous two weeks of material.</p>
<p><em>Presentations (30%)</em></p>
<p>Students will be expected to research the disease handed to the group and return for a group discussion in which a one-page summary and presentation will be evaluated in class. Evaluation will be based on student oral presentation (i.e. content (30%), clarity and timing (20%) and how you answer questions (50%) and the written summary). There will be bonus points for those who ask questions and challenge your colleagues.</p>
<p>The first group presentation will be 30 minutes per group with 15 minutes for the presentation and 15 minutes for questions. The second group presentation will be 40 minutes per group with 20 minutes for presentation and another 20 minutes for questions.</p>
<p>The group presentations are normally held in the last two weeks of classes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The topics for the presentations will be:</p>
<p>First group presentations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hyperadrenocorticism and Diabetes in Dogs</li>
<li>Abomasum Displacement in Dairy Cows</li>
<li>Canine Distemper</li>
<li>Equine Auto-immune Hemolytic Disease</li>
</ol>
<p>Second group presentations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mastitis in Dairy Cows</li>
<li>Mycotoxicosis in Swine</li>
<li>Clinical Ketosis in Dairy Cows</li>
<li>Hypocalcemia in Dairy Cows</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Final examination (40%): </em></p>
<p>The final examination will be cumulative and composed of short answer and essay questions based on basic principles and case studies.</p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Academic Integrity:&nbsp; </em></strong></p>
<p>The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>GOOD LUCK!!!</p>
