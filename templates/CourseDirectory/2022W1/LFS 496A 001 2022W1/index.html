<p><i>Course Description</i></p>
<p><i>The pursuit of a degree is a meaningful experience for many students, ripe with moments to learn about who</i></p>
<p><i>you are, what matters to you, and how you want to contribute to the world. In the 2014 Gallup-Purdue Index</i></p>
<p><i>study, over 30,000 graduates reported that their academic success contributed to the likelihood of their career</i></p>
<p><i>success. The odds of being engaged at work after completing their degree were two times higher for students</i></p>
<p><i>who completed an experience that applied their classroom learning in a work setting (Gallup, 2014). A career</i></p>
<p><i>placement is an excellent opportunity to augment what you have learned about the food system through your</i></p>
<p><i>course work to date and expand on how those theories, approaches, and frameworks apply in a work setting.</i></p>
<p><i>However, learning through experience is not inevitable. In order to maximize the opportunity, this course has</i></p>
<p><i>been created to support and scaffold your learning to strengthen your career development. It will apply the</i></p>
<p><i>principles of Design Thinking and the Designing Your Life framework (Burnett and Evans, 2016) to explore</i></p>
<p><i>your values, interests, skills, strengths and future career aspirations. Consider your placement as a</i></p>
<p><i>prototyping-experience (the 4</i><span><i>th </i></span><i>step in the DYL process), where you can test, try, and evaluate one example of</i></p>
<p><i>work within the food system. By introducing you to tools and strategies for designing and enhancing your</i></p>
<p><i>placement (1</i><span><i>st </i></span><i>time students), and life after (returning students), you will strengthen your agency towards the</i></p>
<p><i>pursuit of meaningful work and a joyful good life.</i></p>
<p><i>Learning Outcomes</i></p>
<p><i>By the end of your placement, students will be able to:</i></p>
<p><i>• Apply the methods and principles of Design Your Life (Burnett and Evans, 2016) to:</i></p>
<p><i>• Empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test current goals to build a meaningful career</i></p>
<p><i>experience.</i></p>
<p><i>• Reflect and articulate the skills learned, values enacted, and strengths applied throughout their career</i></p>
<p><i>placement.</i></p>
<p><i>• Connect with peers, community partners, and the world of work to enhance their professional</i></p>
<p><i>imagination.</i></p>
<p><i>• Relate and describe their career experience to a prototype of future career paths.</i></p>
<p><i>For Returning Students, the addition of:</i></p>
<p><i>• Create and present three possible life designs for future steps beyond LFS 496.</i></p>
<p><i>• Fully apply the DYL framework beyond a career context to your life, in all its dimensions;</i></p>
<p><i>• Empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test current goals to build a meaningful life plan.</i></p>

<p><i>Grade Policy</i></p>
<p><i>This is a graded course based on Assignments (20%) and Career Placement Assessments (80%). The</i></p>
<p><i>assignments are ungraded but will have comments added and marked as Completed once submitted. Each</i></p>
<p><i>assignment will be worth an equal proportion of the 20%. Career Placement assessments (formative at 6</i></p>
<p><i>weeks and summative at end of placement) completed by the Career Placement Supervisors will comprise the</i></p>
<p><i>remainder of the grade.</i></p>
<p><i>Assignments</i></p>
<p><i>Assignments are intended to expose you to different perspectives and expand your understanding of what</i></p>
<p><i>meaningful work can be. The assignments are designed so that you can complete them with little time if you</i></p>
<p><i>are only interested in a cursory exposure to the Designing Your Life framework. However, they are also</i></p>
<p><i>sufficiently robust to allow you a deep dive into the topic if you choose and have the time to devote to it. No</i></p>
<p><i>significant amount of time should be taken from your career placement to complete these assignments.</i></p>
<p><i>Please note: You are to only complete the assignments associated with whether this is your 1</i><span><i>st </i></span><i>or 2</i><span><i>nd</i></span></p>
<p><i>placement. All assignments are posted on Canvas so it is upon you to complete the correct set.</i></p>
