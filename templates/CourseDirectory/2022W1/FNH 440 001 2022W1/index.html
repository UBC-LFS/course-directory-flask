<p>You know how people sometimes say hospital food is bad?</p>
<p>Well, this course is about making it <em>delicious</em>! We’ll work together to learn how to prioritize the values that contribute to creating and serving delicious food, practice these in projects and importantly, have some special guest stars who’ve made food better, healthier, tastier in the places where they work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><em>The Big Idea: <strong>Delicious Food is about People</strong></em></span></p>
<p><em>In this course we hope to answer the questions:</em></p>
<p><em style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 1rem;">How will we be changed once we understand why food is so important to people?</em></p>
<p><em>What larger issues, problems and concepts underlie delivering delicious food to people?</em></p>
<p><em>If this course were a story, what would be the moral of the story?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>By the end of the course, learners will: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>assume responsibility that food should be delicious and how it could be made more delicious</em></li>
<li><em>recognize and remember that food is important to people for a variety of reasons, identify ways to value and empathize with the reasons for their choices, and respond with action to change food service to align with the reasons food is important</em></li>
<li><em>see themselves as interactive and empathetic administrators who support people to prepare and deliver delicious food </em></li>
<li><em>develop ideas in order to advocate for different, more or reprioritized funds, equipment, staff, facilities (et cetera…) and have the advocacy skills to do so.</em></li>
<li><em>reflect on the experience of others working in Food Service, interact with others about their vision of optimizing food service and act as a facilitator of change.</em></li>
<li><em>commit to making delicious food while meeting budget constraints: by critiquing foods and activities against standards, designing or redesigning recipes; producing the food and re-evaluating its deliciousness</em></li>
</ul>

<p>All assignments to be submitted electronically by one group member, to Canvas (paper copies are not required). Point form or narrative style is acceptable, single space, minimum 12 font.</p>
<p>Aim to be concise in reports and assignments. Format written assignments as a business report (aim for quality not quantity) rather than as an essay. All will be evaluated for content and spelling, not presentation.</p>
