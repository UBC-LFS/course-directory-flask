<h1><br>COURSE DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indigenous food systems are a complex, relational web of connections between land, culture, and spirit. This course will cover the major elements of Indigenous food systems, with examples from British Columbia and across the country. Recently, the concept of Indigenous food sovereignty has provided a lens for examining the complexity of Indigenous food systems and is grounded in the idea that Indigenous people should self-determine their food systems and cultural traditions. There are a multitude of factors affecting Indigenous food sovereignty, which will be examined in this course, while also highlighting present-day food stories from Indigenous communities across the country.</p>
<p>This course will cover a broad range of questions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>What is an Indigenous food system?</span></li>
<li><span>What are Indigenous knowledges?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>How does our worldview inform the ways we understand Indigenous peoples, their knowledge systems, and food systems in Canada?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>How have Indigenous food systems been <em>affected</em> by colonialism?</span></li>
<li><span>What are examples of anti-colonial pathways for Indigenous peoples’ food sovereignty?&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>COURSE STRUCTURE</p>
<p>Students will engage with and be guided through a combination of articles, podcasts, videos, and news stories about the values and realities of Indigenous food systems. Classes will be held once a week for three hours, at xʷc̓ic̓əsəm, the Indigenous Health and Research Garden and in classroom spaces. Classes are considered to be a living, breathing space that we all contribute to; your engagement is key to learning, unlearning, and re-learning together. As an introductory course, reading is required. Prior to class time, students are expected to complete readings and access multimedia materials. This course emphasizes engagement over participation via sharing and learning circles.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>LEARNING OUTCOMES</p>
<ol>
<li>To develop an understanding of the vastness and complexities of Indigenous food systems.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><span>To deepen our analysis of the threats and obstacles facing Indigenous food systems.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>To develop an understanding of Indigenous worldviews, values, and epistemologies and how these inform Indigenous food systems.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>To engage in an analysis of colonialism as it pertains to Indigenous bodies, lives, livelihoods, spirits, cultures and lands.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>To explore Indigenous food sovereignty initiatives.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>To compare and contrast the similarities and differences between Western food systems and Indigenous food systems.&nbsp; </span></li>
</ol>

<p>This assignment deals with the subject of Indigenous food systems. You will be asked to create a diagram of your own food system and discuss in three pages how it relates to your own culture and geography. Provide examples of the processes and practices of how you eat. Include social, spiritual (where applicable), emotional, and physical considerations. Provide a concise introduction and conclusion. Your discussion within the body of the assignment should be clear and to the point. Proofread your paper carefully as marks will be deducted for spelling and grammar errors.</p>

<p>Challenges to Indigenous Food Systems Zines</p>

<p>Provide a description and critical discussion of one of the threats to Indigenous food systems in a zine format. A more detailed description of the zine project will be provided in class. Training and support will also be provided by Library Services. Issues to be covered may include colonization, the impact of residential school systems, the high costs of food in the North, climate change, hydro development, pipelines, etc. Based on examples from the course materials, provide an analysis for the potential of Indigenous food sovereignty to create change in spite of the threats, highlighting what is needed to overcome any obstacles. If you are not sure whether you are approaching the topic correctly, contact the instructor. This is a group assignment, but each individual is responsible for four pages of original writing and corresponding images.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>

If you are a student living abroad, you will be subject to the laws of your local jurisdiction, and your local authorities might limit your access to course material or take punitive action against you. UBC is strongly committed to academic freedom, but has no control over foreign authorities (please visit the&nbsp;<span><a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,33,86,0%20">UBC Academic Calendar 2020/21</a></span>&nbsp;for an articulation of the values of the University conveyed in the&nbsp;<span><a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/print.cfm?tree=3,33,86,0">Senate Statement on Academic Freedom</a></span>). Thus, we recognize that students will have legitimate reason to exercise caution in studying certain subjects. If you have concerns regarding your personal situation, consider postponing taking a course with manifest risks, until you are back on campus or reach out to your academic advisor to find substitute courses.&nbsp;</p>
