<p><strong>Course Assessment </strong></p>
<p>Please see below the details of the evaluation criteria. The grading criteria for this course will be:</p>
<p><strong>Assignment/Special Topic Presentation = 30% (Individual Task)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Term Project = 30% (Group Project)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Final Exam = 40%</strong></p>
<p><strong>The assignment </strong>represents a significant part of the course grade, and their successful completion is critical. On our special topic presentation day, we will spend class time discussing the particular topic assigned to each student. Both the students have 40 min each to discuss their topic of interest. The topic should be developed to include the necessary knowledge, fundamentals, current state of the knowledge and should have good depth. A concept/technical presentation of the topic should be made by student. The presentation (20-25 min) will be followed by questions/answers and discussions in class. This will be an in-depth conceptual presentation of the topic like a formal lecture. All class should participate in the discussions as their will be marks based on taking part in discussions. Each student will select a topic by the given date. Students are free to choose the topic of their interest.</p>
<p>Some of the suggested examples may include: Role of water activity in fish Processing, Process optimization in seafood processing, Shelf-life dating, CIP systems, Chemical / Biological Markers used in seafood processing, Hurdle Technology, HACCP in fish Processing, Microbiological Examination of Seafood, Canadian regulations for fish and seafood</p>
<p><strong>Note: No report is required (Only presentation)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Term Project</strong> will be a group project for 30% of total marks. Students are free to choose out of the two options to write the term paper.</p>
<p><strong><em>Style 1: </em></strong></p>
<p>Term paper, in the form of a <strong>scientific review paper</strong> (maximum 6,000 words) on a particular topic relevant to commercially important seafood. A report, professionally written in style appropriate for a scientific review paper, is to be submitted by the last day of the winter term.</p>
<p>Some of the suggested topics can be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application of food processing methods on value-added seafood</li>
<li>Seafood Processing: A safety Perspective</li>
<li>Recent advancements in seafood processing</li>
<li>Recent Advances in Packaging of Fish products</li>
<li>Effect of processing methods on the nutritional properties of commercially important seafood</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Style 2 </em></strong></p>
<p>Students can choose to submit a <strong>research proposal</strong> (maximum 6,000 words) on a novel seafood processing technique and its application. Students are expected to either follow from a gap they have identified in the literature or examine a phenomenon that has not been examined in detail. The proposal should include:</p>
<ol>
<li>The motivation for the proposed research. (Why is it important to study this?)</li>
<li>A thorough review of the relevant literature. (What has already been done in relevant areas of research and what's missing?)</li>
<li>A clear statement of the intended contribution of the proposed research. (How will it improve our understanding of the phenomenon of interest?)</li>
<li>A theoretical framework for the proposed work. (What are the relevant theories?)</li>
<li>A set of research hypotheses. (What are the specific predictions, in connection with the theoretical framework, that is proposed to test?)</li>
<li>A detailed description of the research method that the student proposes to test the hypotheses. (Including plans for experimental design and data collection as well as analysis.)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note: No presentation is required (Only report submission)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong></p>
<p>The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. All UBC students are expected to behave as honest and responsible members of an academic community.  At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is the student's obligation to learn, understand and follow the standards for academic honesty. Students must be aware that standards at the University of British Columbia may be different from those in secondary schools or at other institutions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Violations of academic integrity lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious actions are taken. Plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on an assignment, exam, or course. More serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President's Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Academic misconduct may result in a one-year suspension from the University and a notation of academic discipline on the student's record.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The <a href="http://guides.library.ubc.ca/tutorial-lfs/citing/plagiarism">UBC library</a> has a useful Academic Integrity website that explains what plagiarism is and how to avoid it.  If a student is in any doubt as to the standard of academic honesty in a particular course or assignment, then the student must consult with the instructor as soon as possible. A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University's policies and procedures, may be found in the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,958">Academic Calendar</a><span>.</span>  All course work is required to be submitted to Turnitin.com for review. </p>
<p><strong>University Policies</strong></p>
<p>UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is the suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions.</p>
<p>Details of the policies and how to access support are available on <a href="https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success"><strong>the UBC Senate website</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
