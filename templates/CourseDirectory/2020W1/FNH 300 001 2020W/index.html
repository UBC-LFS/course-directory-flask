<p><strong>Recommended Text </strong>(Available online through UBC library): Singh and Heldman <em>Introduction to Food Engineer- ing</em>. 4th edition. Academic Press (2009)</p>
<p><strong>Calendar Description: </strong>Units and dimensions, mass balance, energy balance, steady  state  and  transient heat flow, fluid handling and measurement.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Prerequisites and Necessary Preparation</h1>
<p>Students must have completed PHYS 101 or PHYS 107 prior to enrolling in this course. It is expected that students will comfortable using mathematics (formulas, systems of equations, derivatives, and integrals) to solve problems. Ideally students will also be familiar with unit conversions and application of “significant figures” (see Wikipedia) when performing calculations.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Course Objectives</h1>
<p>Food Engineering is the combined application of multiple sciences (including but not limited to physics, chemistry and mathematics) and engineering branches (including but not limited to mechanical engineering, chemical engineering and agricultural engineering) in order to understand and design operations in the food industry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bringing food to consumers that is safe, nutritious and delicious presents a number of technical challenges. Food Engineers serve humanity by providing the technical know-how required for transforming the agricultural produce into food, products and services. A good grasp over physics, chemistry and mathematics is a pre-requisite for understanding and designing these food, products and operations.</p>
<p>This course aims to provide an introduction to the fundamental scientific concepts and engineering skills needed to understand commercial food processes, as well as to design simple food systems. The first part of the course covers basic scientific concepts of units and dimensions, mass and energy balances, and thermodynamics. The second part of the courses covers basic fundamentals of transport phenomenon (fluid flow, heat transfer and mass transfer) required for designing unit operations in the food industry. Because of the practical need for quantitative prediction of process outcomes, topics are examined in mathematical as well as descriptive terms.</p>
<p>By the end of this course students should be able to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>employ </strong>a systematic problem-solving method for addressing engineering questions, including making and testing assumptions</li>
<li>
<strong>calculate </strong>mass and energy balances in the context of food processing equipment</li>
<li>
<strong>describe </strong>the different modes of heat and momentum transfer and <strong>explain </strong>the effects of each on a food process of interest to the student</li>
<li>
<strong>select </strong>appropriate mathematical models for a given situation and use them to <strong>calculate </strong>important food processing parameters such as sterilization time, heating/cooling rate, or flow rate</li>
<li>
<strong>estimate </strong>the relative importance of different physical phenomena from dimensionless numbers</li>
<li>
<strong>know </strong>where to look to find information about food engineering principles and processing equipment</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h1>Selection of Food Product</h1>
<p>To give context to the course material and encourage students to learn material that will be of use in their careers, each student must select one of the following commercial food products to focus on. The selected product will be used as the topic for some questions on the homework assignments and exams.</p>
<ul>
<li>Peanut butter or other fats</li>
<li>Canola oil or other types of oil</li>
<li>Canned Products</li>
<li>Frozen Products</li>
<li>Diet Carbonated Beverage</li>
<li>Health supplements</li>
<li>Bars, chocolates and treats</li>
<li>Flour</li>
<li>Other product (must be approved by instructor)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<h2>Quizzes Participation: In class and discussion boards (10% marks)</h2>
<p>Attendance will be tracked by participation in the questions/quizzes in class. 5% marks is allocated for attendance. Percentage of quizzes attended will be directly taken as score for attendance.</p>
<p>Class participation carries a maximum of 5% marks. Students must participate in the discussion boards for the course by posting their own questions and/or answering each other’s questions. The professor/TA will identify incorrect or potentially misleading answers to questions to avoid confusion and may occasionally provide answers as well. Please note that posting partial/complete solutions or inappropriate comments will not be tolerated.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Homework Assignments (15%)</h2>
<p>There will be 8 homework assignments of approximately equal weight. All assignments will be posted on Canvas (canvas.ubc.ca). Assignments <strong>must be submitted  by 5pm  on  the  day  that  they  are  due  and  be  legible to receive full credit</strong>. Assignments may be turned in by 5pm on the day of the next lecture following the due date with a 20% penalty and will not be accepted after that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Midterm Exam – Closed Book - 2 hr (30%).</h2>
<p>Date: 13th October 2020 11am – 1:00pm online via Canvas -&gt; Proctorio. </p>
<p>Questions will be based on Module 1 and 2.</p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>Group Lecture (15%).</h2>
<p><strong>Group Signup:</strong> 30% weightage in the course will be given to Group Activities. 13 Groups with suggested topics for lectures/term-paper will be created on Canvas on 00:01 AM on 14<sup>th</sup> September 2020. Students can enroll in a group of their choice on a first-come first-service basis through Canvas before the Group Sign-up Deadline (18<sup>th</sup> September 2020), after which they will be allocated a group randomly. Each group can accommodate a maximum of 5 members.</p>
<p><strong>Group Lecture:</strong> Each group will deliver a 20-minute group lecture on the group topics and date identified in the Course Content and Course Summary respectively. Each group is already allocated a topic and it is thereby important to sign up for the groups on Canvas - People - Groups as soon as possible after 00:01 AM on 14<sup>th</sup> September 2020. The lectures will be graded equally on following rubric:</p>
<ol>
<li>a) the quality of the lecture delivery;</li>
<li>b) extent of information covered on the proposed topic;</li>
<li>c) ability to answers questions and doubts from other students;</li>
<li>d) quality of the ppt file submitted. </li>
<li>e) Participation in Lectures &amp; question asking. </li>
</ol>
<p>Group lecture evaluation will form 15% of the overall course grade. Final lecture presentation must be uploaded as a .ppt/.pptx file on Canvas before 5pm on the day of lecture. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Surprise Quizzes &amp; Attendance (10%).</h2>
<p>The attendance in the course will be tracked through surprise quizzes.</p>
<p>Best 5 out of 7 quizzes administered will be counted as 5% of the overall course grade. The other 5% will be based on the percentage of quizzes for evaluating attendance in the course.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Extra-curricular participation in the food science sector (3% bonus marks).</h2>
<p>3% extra marks is allocated to students involved in extra-curricular participation in the food science sector.</p>
<p>Any student involved in an extra-curricular activity related directly to food science such as volunteering in a conference, participating in a food-science professional organization, submitting/publishing a manuscript, volunteering in a research group, unpaid internship in a food science company etc. could claim upto 3% extra marks. The activity must be made between 1<sup>st</sup> January 2020 to 31<sup>st</sup> December 2020. All contributions from students will be ranked into 3 category – highest; second highest; and third highest. Maximum 5% of the class with highest contribution will get 3% bonus marks, next 33% of the class with second highest contribution will get 2% bonus marks, and rest of the class with third highest contribution will get 1% bonus marks</p>
<p>In order to claim these marks, submit a 1-page pdf copy of a document titled “Rationale for Extra Marks for STUDENT NAME [GROUP NUMBER]” identifying the student involved and describing the number, nature, and significance of such contributions including the contact information (name, email, phone number) of 1 referee (ideally the direct supervisor/team lead/manager during the contribution) before the start of the final exam.</p>
