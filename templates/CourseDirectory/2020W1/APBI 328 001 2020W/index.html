<p><strong>Class Format</strong></p>
<p>Our class will be a combination of lecture-based learning, problem-based learning, group discussion, guest lectures, and virtual lab work. Mondays and Wednesdays will be live lectures via Zoom and Fridays will be a combination of pre-recorded materials and online work. Our lab will be live via Zoom most weeks and will be a combination of individual and group work.</p>
<p>Each student will be assigned a problem-based working group for the duration of the course. These groups will be created based on the lab section you are enrolled in.</p>
<p>The success of a virtual course such as this relies on your attendance, positive participation, and careful attention to the syllabus. It is my hope that in spite of learning from home, we can work together to create a great virtual community for learning.</p>
<p><strong>Assignments and Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>Following is the list of assignments that make up your evaluation for this course. You will notice that there are no examinations. The virtual environment has provided an opportunity for other methods of evaluating proficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Additional information:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Late Assignments</strong></p>
<p>Please note that assignments are due on the listed due date. Due dates are scheduled for your benefit as well as mine. Assignments are scheduled to try and space out your work load as well as to be relevant to the current topic. If for some reason you are unable to meet a due date, please contact me directly so we can assess if an extension can be given. Late assignments (without having made alternate arrangements) will be penalized at 5 points removed per day late. Missed assignments will be given a 0.</p>
<p><strong>Accommodations</strong></p>
<p>I will attempt to accommodate your learning needs as much as possible. Please contact me at the beginning of term if any changes may be required so that the learning format will work for your unique situation. </p>
<p><strong>Laboratory</strong></p>
<p>While it may seem strange to have a virtual laboratory, to meet the course learning outcomes, the lab is essential. At home activities and problem-based learning are intended to solidify your learning. </p>
