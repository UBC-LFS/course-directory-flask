<p><strong>APBI 312 – Animal Reproduction Physiology</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Course Description:</em></strong></p>
<p>The course aims to provide a detailed description of the function and processes involved in reproductive and digestive physiology and current technologies in domesticated animals. The course will focus on physiological mechanisms related to puberty, reproductive cycle, fertilization, embryo development, pregnancy, parturition. Case scenarios of common problems related to domestic animals will be a key portion of this course.</p>
<p><strong><em>Learning Outcomes:</em></strong></p>
<p>This course should help students develop both the terminology needed to discuss problems associated with the reproduction and digestive physiology of domestic animals. In addition, students should understand the physiological basis for reproductive and nutritional management practices and formulation of strategies to control reproductive processes and improve feed efficiency and the application of current technologies in the different domestic animals.</p>

<p>There are no required textbooks for this course. All assigned readings will be taken from the primary literature (i.e. journal articles) and will be directly available through Canvas. Peer-reviewed reference materials can also be used to provide background information in areas such as biotechnologies applied to reproduction in domestic animals. </p>

<p><strong><em>Testing and Computation:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quizzes every other week – 30% (every other Thursday)</li>
<li>Presentations – 30% (Final two weeks)</li>
<li>Final exam – 40% (TBD)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Quizzes and case studies (30%)</em></p>
<p>The quizzes will be held every other Thursday and will be composed of short answer questions related to the previous two weeks of material.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Presentations (30%): </em></p>
<p>Assignments about a disease/situation will be handed to students in the final portion the class. Students will be expected to research the topic and return for a group discussion in which a one-page summary and presentation will be evaluated in class. Evaluation will be based on student oral presentation (i.e. content (30%), clarity and timing (20%) and how you answer questions (50%) and the written summary). There will be bonus points for those who ask questions and challenge your colleagues. The first group presentation will be 15 minutes per group with 7-8 minutes for the presentation and 7-8 minutes for questions.</p>

<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Academic Integrity:  </em></strong></p>
<p>The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences. </p>
<p>GOOD LUCK!!!</p>
