<p><strong>Knowledge Production In LFS: Joining and Adding to Conversations </strong></p>
<p>Through the study and application of the principles of university-level discourse and with emphasis on the genre of academic writing, this course (your course!) will introduce students in the faculty of LFS to critical reading and academic writing both generally, and in the context of their specific discipline. Instruction will focus on the rhetorical principles and strategies central to university-level discourse. Students (you!) will apply critical reading skills to scholarly and popular readings, develop reasoned arguments and join academic conversations on issues raised in readings, carry out independent research, and produce a formal research essay within the discipline of LFS. The focus of our course will be on skills development, which is to say “strategic” writing: so, practicing skills of summary and analysis, exploring techniques for generating ideas, planning and producing a research essay, and participating in collaborative writing, editing, and revising. You will gain an understanding of the nature of academic discourse, become more proficient and confident in accessing and producing university-level writing, develop an awareness of the intellectual concerns both central and lateral to the discipline of LFS, and begin to perceive yourselves as active participants in the academic community of your faculty and the university.</p>

<p><strong>Readings (and where to find them):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The “modules” on Canvas will have links to the (scholarly) readings for our course.</li>
<li>
<em>They Say/I Say</em> (TSIS) and <em>The Little Brown Essential Handbook</em> style guide (TLB) can be bought at the UBC bookstore or through the UBC bookstore <a href="https://shop.bookstore.ubc.ca/courselistbuilder.aspx">https://shop.bookstore.ubc.ca/courselistbuilder.aspx</a> either as physical books or e-books. You may also buy them elsewhere.<span>  </span><span> </span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Canvas</strong></p>
<p>Our class, because of Covid19, will be delivered online.  You will all familiarize yourselves with Canvas (for all of your classes) as the semester progresses.  Canvas's week-by-week "Modules" is probably the best place to start.</p>
<p><strong>Participation and “Attendance”</strong></p>
<p>While our remote “online” learning version of LFS 150 is scheduled to meet for one hour a day, three days a week, for thirteen weeks, Covid-19 has made necessary a shift in the way we imagine teaching and learning.<span>  </span>Our class WILL have in-person “lectures” and engagement, synchronously so – through Zoom. I find that student engagement is fundamentally important to an enjoyable, educational class: this means that you also attend Zoom classes on Wednesday (articles and reading questions Q&amp;A) and Friday (writing journal writing prompts and practice).<span>  </span>Your engagement/participation means turning on your microphones and cameras and speaking out loud, contributing to the class as it were, making the class dialogical.<span>  </span>I will require that all of you turn your cameras on for each lecture (if your technology and internet connection allows), and that all of you are willing and eager to “raise your hands” and activate your voices.<span>   </span></p>
<p>However, my CHIEF CONCERN is the mental health and well-being of my students in these unprecedented and very difficult times.<span>  </span>I want our class to be fun, interesting, instructional and a break from the monotony of our Covid-19 lives.<span>  </span>However, we can’t all be ON all the time, or even for extended periods of time, especially when our class is only one of four (or five or more) that you’re taking this term.<span>  </span> I will endeavour to make the course as engaging as possible in hopes that it inspires and sustains.<span>  </span>While I think it important for you all to take the class and be present for it – especially since effective writing requires collaboration – if your life and sanity requires you elsewhere, I understand.<span>       </span></p>
<p>Having said the above, one way to think about attendance and participation, or even overall engagement and active presence in class (be it in a classroom or online), is to think about a class in terms of the reference letters you might ask of your instructors in the future.<span>  </span>I am asked to write many reference letters, but write few.<span>  </span>I can only write a reference letter for a student who became the type of student for whom a reference letter is easy to write; so, become the type of student who it is easy to write a letter for: one who is engaged and memorable, focused and interested, dedicated and accountable.<span>     </span></p>
<p><strong>Evaluation &amp; Writing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Assignments</em> explain, in detail, what is required in each assignment; I teach to the assignments.</li>
<li>
<em>Readings: </em>please have the articles and chapters read before we discuss them.</li>
<li>Your <em>Writing Journal</em> will contain answers to reading questions (posted on Canvas’s “Announcements”), Friday’s writing exercises, and ComPAIR exercises, and will help <strong>you</strong> evaluate how well you have understood the instructions, if you’re writing effectively, and whether your writing needs editing and drafting and revising. Handed in near the end of the term (keep them until then), they will be evaluated in terms of their completeness and clear organization, for 15% of your overall grade.<span>  </span>Please use your <em>Writing Journal</em> actively, which is to say these journals are opportunities for you to get feedback on your writing during class or during office hours; editing and drafting and revising, with the help of feedback, are essential to effective writing.<span>    </span>
</li>
<li>
<em>Grading</em>: assignments are assigned letter grades. Assignments are evaluated with rigorous criteria, fairly, and by a professional with extensive experience – discussing your writing is fine (and sometimes necessary for improvement or clarification), but the evaluations are earned by your writing’s quality and effectiveness. If you need help decoding the feedback on your assignments, please ask.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Access and Diversity Accommodation</strong></p>
<p>Students who require reasonable accommodations to fully participate in course activities or meet course <span>        </span>requirements must register with Access and Diversity. Bring your letter of accommodation to me as soon as possible and I will be happy to discuss suitable arrangements.</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Late or Missed Assignments or Missed Classes</strong></p>
<p>Late assignments are penalized with an immediate 10% deduction and 5% per day after, including weekends – manage your time so you don’t lose valuable percentage points. As I do not re-teach classes, please catch up on missed material with your peers.<span> </span></p>
<p>HOWEVER, communication is KEY!<span>  </span>Please communicate with me, before the fact, any extenuating circumstances that lead to absences, or lead to handing in an assignment late.<span>  </span>Covid-19 requires that we be kind to each other; kindness means, sometimes, excusing absences and granting extensions; kindness to ourselves means, sometimes, asking for absences to be excused and asking for extensions.<span>  </span>Communication, before the fact, is really important (unless unavoidable).<span>  </span></p>
<p><strong>Student Hours and Open "Zoom Door" Policy and Communication</strong></p>
<p><em>I encourage students to talk to me; in fact, I welcome your “visits”, and so does your TA. </em>While Wednesdays and Fridays will be opportunities to ask questions about your writing in class, student hours are opportunities to ask more questions.<span> </span>Your instructor has 3 student hours scheduled per week; your TA has one student hour scheduled per week.<span>  </span>These student hours will happen virtually, on Zoom. Come hang out during student hours! Timely communication is essential; I know how challenging being a student can be; sometimes, with UBC’s requirement that we focus on results, we need to remember that we are people, and people need support; let us know how we can help you through those challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Plagiarism </strong></p>
<p>All writing must be your original work.<span>  </span>The minimum penalty for improper documentation is an “F” for the assignment.<span> </span>More serious cases of plagiarism warrant dismissal from the class and possible disciplinary action from the University.<span>  </span>Students should acquaint themselves with the University’s policy’s on academic misconduct and specifically plagiarism here: <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,959">http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,959.</a>  Students will also "sign" an academic integrity pledge.  </p>
<p><strong>Copyright Clause</strong></p>
<p>Please <strong>do not record</strong> the class unless you have explicit <strong>written</strong> permission to do so from me. This includes voice activated note-taking computers and taking photos of notes on screens. You may not post any of the lecture material online (on Youtube, Facebook, any social media site, or anywhere else public) or share it with anyone who is not registered in the class.<span> </span></p>
<p><span>All original materials of this course (syllabus, course handouts, lecture slides, assessments, curation of course readings, etc.) are the intellectual property of the course Instructor.  Redistribution of these materials by any means without permission of the copyright holder(s) constitutes a breach of copyright and may lead to academic discipline.</span></p>
<p><strong>International Students' Privacy and Freedom of Expression:</strong></p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span>The Provost’s office has developed the following statement pertaining to the potential restrictions to international students’ online learning experiences as a result of remote learning:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><i>During this pandemic, the shift to online learning has greatly altered teaching and studying at UBC, including changes to health and safety considerations. Keep in mind that some UBC courses might cover topics that are censored or considered illegal by non-Canadian governments. This may include, but is not limited to, human rights, representative government, defamation, obscenity, gender or sexuality, and historical or current geopolitical controversies. If you are a student living abroad, you will be subject to the laws of your local jurisdiction, and your local authorities might limit your access to course material or take punitive action against you. UBC is strongly committed to academic freedom, but has no control over foreign authorities (please visit http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,33,86,0 for an articulation of the values of the University conveyed in the Senate Statement on Academic Freedom). Thus, we recognize that students will have legitimate reason to exercise caution in studying certain subjects. If you have concerns regarding your personal situation, consider postponing taking a course with manifest risks, until you are back on campus or reach out to your academic advisor to find substitute courses.

<p><strong><span>Tips for Doing Well – from previous students!</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>“Do your readings and keep up with your reading questions! They may seem like a pain but they help and guide your learning! They help you to get the most out of the course! Make [the] exercises an opportunity to learn more about different topics instead of just completing the assignment to get it over with!”</span></li>
<li><span>“Take ComPAIR seriously. Seriously, it’s really helpful.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Be patient with yourself[;] it is a process. Trust in Duffy and reach out to him… Stay on top of all of your work especially your writing journal; trust me you will thank yourself later. Don't take yourself too seriously. Don't be afraid to push the boundaries and your boundaries of what you want to learn. In this class you have a lot of power in subject matter you want to explore so take advantage of the opportunity. Language is power and has a power over you. Speak to yourself with words of positivity regarding this course even if you don't absolutely love it (which is hard to imagine) because as soon as you have a negative voice in your head doubt, negativity and disappointment will follow.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Keep up with the writing journals and don't save them all until the end! - pick a topic for your research paper that you are genuinely interested in and passionate about! - think of writing as something you get to do, not something you have to do! It's a great opportunity to learn how to effectively communicate and have your own voice!”</span></li>
<li><span>“Start brainstorming for your assignments long before the due date! Very few creative ideas will come out of cramming an essay or PIE/CEI paragraph out the night before it is to be handed in. Spend a bit of time thinking through various ideas and choosing the best ones before you begin writing. Also, read it over as many times as possible, leaving time between proofreads, as you'd be surprised how you see things differently after taking a step back. “</span></li>
<li><span>“Stay on top of the assignments and practice, practice, practice ("doing well" is a process that takes time and you might not get it the first time).”</span></li>
<li><span>“Keep your papers, handouts, assignments, homework, and notes organized.”</span></li>
<li><span>“1) Follow instructions 2) Do all the assignments thoroughly including reading journals. This is good practice 3) Don't leave writing to the last minute 4) Ask people about your writing. See what ideas they have.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Don't hand in your first draft. Start writing one draft with most of your points and ideas, and from there, produce more drafts by adding, removing, editing, and revising ideas and sentences. Don't wait until the last minute to write your papers. Allot enough time for multiple drafts. Start your assignment as early as possible to allow yourself to think about your ideas or questions. These extra days will allow you to ask yourself (or your professor) any questions you might have about the assignment, and these extra days will allow your brain to think more critically about your points and ideas. (i.e. one day you might think your point is great, but the next day you might think your point is redundant)”</span></li>
<li><span>“Do lots of practice reading scholarly papers to spot for KGs + ask prof for help”</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>“Read the requirements of each assignment carefully!”</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>“You have to persevere through the frustration of having to write paper; it's gonna be worth it in the end.”</span></li>
