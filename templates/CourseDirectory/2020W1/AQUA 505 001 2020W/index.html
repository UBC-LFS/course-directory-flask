</h2>
<h3>Course Overview</h3>
<p>By 2030, seafood from aquaculture is projected to be the primary source of animal protein as the demand for seafood overtakes the harvest potential of wild capture fisheries. However, as the aquaculture industry expands its output to meet this need, the impacts on the natural environment must be minimized to ensure a sustainable development of the sector. For aquaculture to be sustainable, it must meet the following criteria: effluents, water quality and disease must be effectively managed, wild broodstock, eggs and juveniles must be responsibly sourced, feed must be sustainably sourced, and escapees must be managed to minimize the impact of wild populations. These issues will be discussed in a global perspective, as well as a focus on issues specific to British Columbia.</p>
<p>This course introduces the different aspects in which aquaculture can impact the natural environment and which aquaculture systems and management practices can minimize or mitigate these impacts. Students will learn about ecological, social and ethical aspects of various aquaculture systems through a combination of lectures, review of the primary literature and class discussions. As natural resources become increasingly limited, this course is highly relevant to the developing aquaculture industry and will provide students entering the aquaculture sector with the knowledge to employ sustainable practices to minimize environmental impacts.</p>
<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The main goals are for students to be able to:</span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">·       identify different aspects of aquaculture that can impact the environment</span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">·       critically assess different aquaculture systems based on their environmental impact and sustainability, as well as ethical concerns</span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">·       discuss implementable management techniques within  federal and provincial regulations that can mitigate environmental issues arising from unsustainable aquaculture practices</span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">·       be aware of social concerns relating to First Nation issues with aquaculture</span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Upon completion of the course, you will be able to understand environmental issues related to aquaculture; appreciate the importance of sustainable aquaculture and conservation of wildlife and its natural habitat; recognize unsustainable aquaculture practices and identify management techniques to mitigate environmental impact; understand federal and provincial governmental regulations related to aquaculture in Canada and BC; be aware of social and ethical issues relating aquaculture to First Nations concerns.</span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Learning Activities</span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Weekly discussions, term papers and an oral presentation will assist you in reaching these learning outcomes. There will be some overlap between the courses within the Graduate Certificate, allowing you to deepen the material. The final group project will be joint between AQUA 501 and 506 to apply the learned material to a unique aquaculture system designed by you!</span></h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>Learning Materials</h3>
<p>There is no textbook required. Weekly readings of primary literature are provided on the Canvas webpage under Files.</p>

<h3>Details of Assessments</h3>
<ul>
<li>The students will be evaluated based on participation during discussions (10%), a term paper (45%) due in week 7 and a final project with oral presentation in week 14 (45%)</li>
<li>For the term paper, students will choose an aquaculture system and critically assess it based on sustainability and environmental impact and discuss management techniques available to mitigate environmental issues</li>
<li>The final project will be a joint project with Production Systems (501) and Business Concepts (506): the students will write an environmental impact assessment for their planned aquaculture system and will present this project as their final. They graded as a group on the project and individually on their ability to answer questions after the presentation.</li>
<li>68% constitutes a pass</li>

<h3>Final examination (oral)</h3>
<p>The examination period for Winter Term is week 14.  Except in the case of examination clashes and hardships (three or more formal examinations scheduled within a 24-hour period) or unforeseen events, students will be permitted to apply for out-of-time final examinations only if they are representing the University, the province, or the country in a competition or performance; serving in the Canadian military; observing a religious rite; working to support themselves or their family; or caring for a family member.  Unforeseen events include (but may not be limited to) the following: ill health or other personal challenges that arise during a term and changes in the requirements of an ongoing job. </p>
<p>Further information on Academic Concession can be found under Policies and Regulation in the <em> Academic Calendar </em><a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,48,0,0">http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,48,0,0</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span>University Policies</span></h2>
<p>UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions.</p>
<p>Details of the policies and how to access support are available on <a href="https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success">the UBC Senate website</a><strong>.</strong></p>
<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply when the matter is referred to the Office of the Dean. Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences. A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,0,0">UBC Calendar: Student Conduct and Discipline</a>.</p>
<h3>Academic Accommodation for Student with Disabilities</h3>
<p>Academic accommodations help students with a disability or ongoing medical condition overcome challenges that may affect their academic success. Students requiring academic accommodations must register with the <a href="https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/centre-for-accessibility">Centre for Accessibility</a>. They will determine the student's eligibility for accommodations in accordance with <a href="https://universitycounsel-2015.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2019/08/Disability-Accommodation-Policy_LR7.pdf?file=2010/08/policy73.pdf">Policy 73: Academic Accommodation for Students with Disabilities</a>. Academic accommodations are not determined by your instructors, and instructors should not ask you about the nature of your disability or ongoing medical condition, or request copies of your disability documentation. However, your instructor may consult with the Centre for Accessibility should the accommodations affect the essential learning outcomes of a course.</p>
