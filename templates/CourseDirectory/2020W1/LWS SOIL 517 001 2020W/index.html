<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Class Time:</u></strong></p>
<p>Monday at 9 am PST <em>OR</em> Friday at 4 pm PST. Students must attend one class session per week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Description:</u></strong></p>
<p>            This course focuses on a “systems” approach to assessing and evaluating land and water resources. It provides guidance in critical reading, methods and approaches to assessing and interpreting information based on different values and governance systems. The aim is to provide students the opportunity to develop processes and experiences by which they can facilitate their academic disciplinary experience into a more holistic framework. The outcome will be to aid student learning on how to integrate the academic information from across disciplines and focus that integration into credible arguments for effective oral and written communication.</p>
<p><u> </u></p>
<p><strong><u>Prerequisites and/or Co-requisites</u></strong></p>
<p>            Must be a graduate student enrolled in the MLWS or Soil Science programs. Other graduate or upper level undergraduate students from similar programs at UBC may take the course with permission from the instructors, and if deemed beneficial, an interview.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Course Structure</u></strong></p>
<p>            LWS/SOIL 517 is being offered online in the 2020 Term 1 Session. Students are expected to attend one online session a week in order to discuss the weekly course material, hear about upcoming assignments and course activities, and ask any questions. There will be assigned readings and lecture material posted in canvas each week. The weekly lecture material will highlight a particular land and water issue or theme. Students are expected to review the required materials in their own time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Learning Objectives</u></strong></p>
<p><em>By the end of this course, learners will be able to:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss different approaches to <strong>“systems” thinking </strong>in the land and water context,</li>
<li>Describe the <strong>land-water-energy nexus </strong>and its implications for natural resource management,</li>
<li>
<strong>Ask the right questions </strong>to address science versus management challenges in land and water systems,</li>
<li>Evaluate a range of different information resources (ranging from biophysical to socioeconomic) through <strong>critical reading</strong>,</li>
<li>Understand the role of various <strong>levels of government </strong>regulations and how they <strong>interrelate in land and water management</strong> decision-making, and</li>
<li>Integrate academic information from across disciplines and focus it into a integrated <strong>holistic framework </strong>to facilitate the development and delivery of credible arguments for assessing and evaluating land and water systems.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Course Expectations</u></strong></p>
<p>            Students are expected to attend all class sessions, complete their assignments and readings on time and prepare actively to participate in class sessions. This will help to improve your success in this course.</p>

<p><strong><u>Academic Integrity</u></strong></p>
<p>            The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means substituting only original work done by you and acknowledging all other sources of information and ideas and attributing them to others as required. This means you should also not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work.</p>
<p>            Violations of academic integrity (i.e. misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise, and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on an assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent reoccurrences.</p>
