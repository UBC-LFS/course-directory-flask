<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Course Format</u></strong></p>
<p><span>The course will include in-class lectures, guest lectures, field trips, and a group project.  Contact time 3 hours per week or more during field trips.  The Canvas learning platform will be used for this course.  Lectures will be over Zoom.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><strong><u>Course Overview, Content, and Objectives</u></strong></p>
<p><span>The purpose of the course is to provide a general broad overview of global finfish aquaculture production, as well as local production.  Students will learn about the various purposes of aquaculture and the types of aquaculture systems.  Through seminars, reading materials, guest lectures, and field trips, the course will expose students to the variety of aquaculture systems and methods in use, with particular focus on intensive systems and systems currently employed in the local industry.  Systems include open systems, ponds and raceways, net pens, recirculating aquaculture systems, as well as integrated multi-trophic aquaculture.  Students will develop teamwork skills as they prepare a group feasibility study.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Learning Outcomes</u></strong></p>
<p><span>After completing this course, students should be able to:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Compare global aquaculture efficiencies relative to other animal production,</li>
<li>Identify the various applications of aquaculture,</li>
<li>Differentiate the various types of aquaculture systems in use, including the benefits and drawbacks of each,</li>
<li>Evaluate the feasibility of an aquaculture business,</li>
<li>Demonstrate the ability to work with a group to research, prepare and present a report.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Additional Course Requirements</u></strong></p>
<p><span>Students will be required to participate in field trips.  Trips will vary in length, normally taking most of a day.  Transportation will be by bus car, plane, or some other means as developed in consideration of physical distancing requirements.  Students will be responsible for packing their own lunch and snacks for fieldtrips.  Students must dress for wet and cold conditions on some of the field trips.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Evaluation Criteria and Grading </u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Group Project (50%) - In student groups of between 2 - 5, students will complete a feasibility study or a business plan on a theoretical new aquaculture venture of their choice. The project could include the farming of a common or alternative species to aquaculture, and farming using an existing or emerging technology.<span>  </span>A written report will be submitted and the project will be presented orally.<span>  </span>Students will be evaluated on their ability to evaluate the economic, technical and biological feasibility of the venture, teamwork, and presentation. (Learning Outcome 3 - 5)</li>
<li>Participation (5%) - the course will be interactive and require participation during class and field trips. Participation will be evaluated by their class discussion of opinions, ideas, and perspectives related to the course.<span>  </span>Classroom, field trip, and on-line participation aligns with the broad academic skills of critical thinking, connecting and creating ideas, and defending perspectives or arguments. (Learning Outcome 1- 4)</li>
<li>Final Exam (45%) - The final exam will be open book format and will test the ability to explain the efficiencies of aquaculture, and the understanding of the types of aquaculture systems. (Learning Outcome 1- 4)</li>
<li>The course will be graded on a numeric basis.</li>
</ul>
