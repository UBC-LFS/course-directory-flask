<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Course</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">SOIL 530 is a directed study course in which the student is required to complete readings, assignments, and an individual research project outside of a formal class setting. The individual research project will be library-based (literature review or meta-analysis). The research project will be within the field of soil reclamation (restoration, rehabilitation) and/or remediation, with a specific focus requiring approval of the instructor. This course will require students to apply knowledge from previous courses and experiences and to use critical thinking and judgment in the application of theory and principles. The course will focus on the application of principles, practices, and philosophies of soil reclamation and remediation, with emphasis on ecological services and sustainability.</p>
