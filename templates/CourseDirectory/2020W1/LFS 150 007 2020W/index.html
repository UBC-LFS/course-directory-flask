<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will respond to emails and direct messages through Canvas within 24 hours between 9:00–4:30 Monday to Friday. <strong>I am here to support your learning</strong>. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns about assignments, topics we are exploring in class, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Office hours</strong>: I will be hosting weekly drop-in coffee chats around a theme related to what we're learning that week. Come drop in via Zoom and chat about the theme or about anything on your mind! The coffee chat will be at the same time and day each week and the link will be posted weekly. If you'd like to meet with me one-on-one, message me and we'll make an appointment. </span></p>
<p><strong>LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of British Columbia is located on the traditional, ancestral and unceded territory of the Musqueam people. It is our responsibility to honour the stewards of this land by educating ourselves about the histories and contemporary realities of First Peoples, and by contributing to the important work of reconciliation and decolonization.</span></p>
<p><strong>COURSE DESCRIPTION </strong><strong>    </strong></p>
<p>During this course, you will learn how to communicate concepts of land and food systems and their links to human and environmental health. We will explore academic writing strategies, argumentation, learn how to evaluate evidence, and search for and cite references to back up claims. By the end of this course, I am confident you will be a better writer than you were when you started!</p>
<p><strong>WHAT TEXTBOOK DO YOU NEED? </strong></p>
<p>We will be using mostly online resources for this class, with the exception of one small, but mighty, textbook that you can buy through the <a href="https://bookstore.ubc.ca/textbooks">bookstore</a> or through <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/They-Say-Matter-Academic-Writing/dp/0393631672/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_0/140-0430308-9575564?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=0393631672&amp;pd_rd_r=72b44b23-b972-415e-97f0-c8f5eaa1ecb4&amp;pd_rd_w=ffiQ8&amp;pd_rd_wg=K9Xe0&amp;pf_rd_p=256a14b6-93bc-4bcd-9f68-aea60d2878b9&amp;pf_rd_r=MRSRQZY8YAXX83X8FM90&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=MRSRQZY8YAXX83X8FM90">Amazon</a>:</p>

<p><strong>ACADEMIC HONESTY</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use someone else’s work without clearly acknowledging the source—this is plagiarism. This includes paraphrasing or directly quoting any work, published or unpublished, that another person wrote without clearly acknowledging that person as the source. If you allow someone else to do your work for you and claim that work as your own, you will have committed collusion, which is a form of plagiarism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am committed to helping you work honestly, and I will help you learn how to avoid these mistakes. If you have any questions about whether you might be plagiarizing without knowing it, please ask me before you turn in your assignment.</span></p>
<p><strong>A NOTE ON GRADES</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's important to keep up with your readings, activities and assignments so your work doesn’t pile up. But if, for any reason, you cannot submit an assignment on the due date, you must contact me at least 24 hours in advance to discuss a possible extension. <br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>I look forward to getting to know you this semester!</strong> </span></p>
<div id="course_syllabus" class="user_content enhanced">
<p><span><strong>Please review the following statement from the Office of the Provost: </strong></span></p>
<p>During this pandemic, the shift to online learning has greatly altered teaching and studying at UBC, including changes to health and safety considerations. Keep in mind that some UBC courses might cover topics that are censored or considered illegal by non-Canadian governments. This may include, but is not limited to, human rights, representative government, defamation, obscenity, gender or sexuality, and historical or current geopolitical controversies. If you are a student living abroad, you will be subject to the laws of your local jurisdiction, and your local authorities might limit your access to course material or take punitive action against you. UBC is strongly committed to academic freedom, but has no control over foreign authorities (please visit http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,33,86,0 for an articulation of the values of the University conveyed in the Senate Statement on Academic Freedom). Thus, we recognize that students will have legitimate reason to exercise caution in studying certain subjects. If you have concerns regarding your personal situation, consider postponing taking a course with manifest risks, until you are back on campus or reach out to your academic advisor to find substitute courses.
