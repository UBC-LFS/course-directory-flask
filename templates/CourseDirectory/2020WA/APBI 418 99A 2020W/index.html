<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>The emphasis of the course is on basic fish physiology, fish-water interactions, fish-water-pathogen interactions, and general salmonid husbandry techniques and principles. An understanding of the biology of fish is imperative to allow a more complete understanding of culture techniques and requirements. Management of finfish throughout the life cycle; brood-stock, egg, larvae and juvenile will be examined in this context as will the control of environmental factors, including pathogens, for maximum productivity at all life stages.</p>
<p>A visit to a fish culture facility is required.</p>
<h2>Prerequisite</h2>
<p>APBI 312 or BIOL 204 or BIOL 361, or BIOL 364, or permission of the instructor.</p>
<h2>Intended Student</h2>
<p>In order to be successful at fish culture, it is imperative to understand the animals themselves and their requirements. This course is intended for those wishing an introduction to the biology of fish in culture and/or the practicing fish culturist wishing further training in the basic principles behind the practice of intensive fish production. Students in the past have come from a wide variety of backgrounds and talents.</p>
<h2>Course Objectives</h2>
<p>The course has four main goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>to provide you with knowledge in basic fish physiology;</li>
<li>to have you appreciate the interactions between the fish and its environment. Interactions include physical (water) as well as biological (other fish, pathogens) components;</li>
<li>to introduce the fundamental facilities and technology as well as the current methods utilized in the intensive production of fish;</li>
<li>to provide you with the basic tools for understanding the principles in all the major aspects of intensive finfish aquaculture.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>This course consists of 5 main units:</p>
<p><em><strong>Module I: Aquaculture and Aquatic Farming</strong></em></p>
<p>This module provides an introduction to the subject material. This module will define what aquaculture is; present a historical perspective of aquaculture; explain the concept of aquaculture production systems, methods, and their characteristics; describe the general life cycle of the salmonid fishes and explain the importance of this information to the aquatic farmer.</p>
<p><em><strong>Module II: Anatomy and Physiology of Salmonid Fishes</strong></em></p>
<p>This module introduces the basic anatomical structures of the fish and investigates their importance. It will guide you through many of the important physiological adaptations that fish have evolved to exist in the aquatic environment.</p>
<p><em><strong>Module III: Salmonid Husbandry and Management</strong></em></p>
<p>In this section students will examine the needs of the fish with respect to its environment; how fish affect their environment; culture techniques for broodstock, incubation, early rearing, grow-out as well as look at handling grading, tagging and transport.</p>
<p><em><strong>Module IV: Fish Health</strong></em></p>
<p>This final section of the course will examine the health systems that fish possess. It will also provide a survey of some of the more economically important diseases both infectious and non.</p>
<h2>Assignments</h2>
<p>There are four written assignments to be completed by the student. The first three assignments are worth 10% of the course mark and the final assignment is worth 20%. The final examination is worth 30% of the course total. Lesson quizzes comprise the remaining 20%.</p>
<h2><span>About the final examination</span></h2>
<p>Students MUST have completed at least 30% of the required course work (Assignments, Lesson Quizzes, Site Visit Report) before being allowed to write the Final Examination.</p>
<p>The Final Examination for this course will be a standard written exam that will be invigilated online via Proctorio.</p>
