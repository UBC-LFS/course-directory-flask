<h3>Course Structure</h3>
<p>You are responsible to read the 13 lessons throughout the term. It is expected that you will spend about 10 hours on this course on average each week. To help you focus on important concepts in each lesson and to keep pace you will complete the lesson quizzes each week. For the majority of lessons, there are also journals which help you reflect on your learning. The course content is connected to the real-world through a term project, which is composed of several smaller assignments. The course material is examined through a midterm and final exam, both of which are administered online through Canvas. All assignments are completed online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a general rhythm to this course and it is recommended that you keep the following schedule.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Monday - New lesson is assigned. Read weekly summary to understand what is expected of you. Read this lesson throughout the week while making notes that relate to each of the lesson's objectives. Complete your reading by the weekend.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Saturday/Sunday - Complete the journal and quiz that accompany the assigned lesson.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If your week gets too busy to finish your readings by Friday take the weekend to read them. Make sure you do your journal by Monday morning.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Journal Discussions</strong></h4>
<p>The purpose of the journals is to create awareness of your learning and connect the course material to your everyday world. Each journal should take about 30 mins to complete. There is a minimum of 200 words and a maximum of 500 words.</p>
<p>Your journal response should include <span style="font-size: 1rem;">a statement of opinion, which is explained in the context of personal experience and course content. It concludes with how your new knowledge could impact future actions or understanding.</span></p>
<p>The journals are graded for completeness as judged by the length (minimum 200 words and maximum 500 words), appropriate response to prompt, and punctuality. If the journal is complete, 1 mark is awarded. Late submission is <strong>NOT</strong> acceptable, even if a&nbsp; journal is as little as one minute late, automatically, a score of 0 is awarded. You only need to complete 8 journals on time to receive full marks. Please note that there are a total of 10 journals.</p>
<p>Instructors and TA's will leave limited comments on your journal discussions.&nbsp; Journals are due Mondays by 11:59 pm.</p>
<h4><strong>Quizzes&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>The quizzes are graded and you have as many attempts as you like for each quiz until the last day of class. There are suggested deadlines for each quiz. The deadlines are to assist you in keeping pace with the course. If you don't get the quiz done before the suggested date, it will be marked as late but this does not affect your grade. All quizzes are due on the last day of class at 11:59 pm. Afterwards, your marks will be calculated and the final grade will appear under the heading "Quizzes Grade Final."</p>
<h4><strong>Term Project&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>The goal of the term project is to find real-world examples of our lessons in Food Science; and bring the course material to life. By completing this project, you can apply the concepts of the course to evaluate your understanding of the rationale and processes used for food preservation.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to form a group of 2-4 students, or you may work individually on this project. The same criteria will be used to mark individual and group Projects. I highly recommend you to create a group for the term project. In this way you can learn from each other and also the <strong>workload will be divided</strong>. Students who work collaboratively within their group will be awarded with <strong>1% bonus mark</strong>. For more details, please go to the “<strong>Term Project”</strong> page in the “<strong>Home"</strong> section. The term project is composed of the following steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Term Project group selection (1% bonus mark if you work collaboratively within a group)</li>
<li>Term Project 1(12.5%)</li>
<li>Term Project 2 (12.5%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once your Project marks are out, you can access your Project and review the comments provided by your TA along with the details of the points deducted. The grade and feedback on your project will appear under the “Term Project” in the “Grades” section.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:&nbsp;</strong>Please review the “<strong>Project Format”&nbsp;</strong>section prior to writing your Project. Correct citation and format compliance are necessary. Projects without citation will not be marked. Read through the&nbsp;<u>“<strong>citation</strong></u><strong>”</strong>&nbsp;section below and follow the guidelines.</p>
<h4><strong>Citation</strong></h4>
<p>Throughout the course assignments, even in the discussion board, you will be using different sources (lessons, lecture notes, reading materials, video clips, provided links, etc.) which need to be cited individually and correctly.&nbsp;In your assignment, you need to have a bibliography or list of references as well as in-text citation (listing all your resources at the end, is not enough for meeting the requirements.)</p>
<p>Please use&nbsp;<strong>APA style&nbsp;</strong>for citation-review the following links to learn about APA style.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Midterm&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>The midterm is a limited-open-book exam which will cover lessons 1-5. It will incorporate a variety of question formats (true/false, matching terms to definitions, multiple-choice, and short answer). The midterm will be conducted online using Canvas and Respondus LockDown Browser. You will be given a window of time on a specific day on which you can take the midterm. Once you begin the midterm there is a set time limit in which to complete it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with LockDown Browser, it is important that you try the practice exam prior to the midterm so that you ensure you meet the technical requirements. Please read all the instructions prior to the exam.</p>
<h4><strong>Final Exam&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>The final examination will cover material from lesson 1-13. The final exam will be a limited-open-book exam. You will not need to come to campus to take the final exam. It will be conducted online using Canvas and Zoom. The exam will consist of a combination of multiple-choice, fill in the blank, matching and short answer questions. The final examination will be scheduled by the Registrar's office and will be held during the final examination period.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>University Policies</h3>
<p>UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions.</p>
<p>Details of the policies and how to access support are available on <a href="https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success"><strong>the UBC Senate website</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

</ul>
<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.</p>
<p>A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the Academic Calendar at <a href="http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0">http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0</a>.</p>

In this course, I plan to use analytics data to:&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Reach Out for Success</h3>
<p>University students often encounter setbacks from time to time that can impact academic performance. If you encounter difficulties and need assistance, I encourage you to contact me at any time by e-mail. We can also arrange a time to meet virtually. I will do my best to support your success during this term. This includes identifying concerns I may have about your academic progress or well being through Early Alert. With Early Alert, faculty members can connect you with advisors who offer support and assistance to help students get back on track to success. Only specialized UBC advisors would be able to access any concerns I may identify, and Early Alert does not affect your academic record. For more information, visit the program website: <a href="http://www.earlyalert.ubc.ca">www.earlyalert.ubc.ca</a>. For information about addressing mental or physical health concerns, including seeing a UBC counsellor or doctor visit: <a href="http://students.ubc.ca/livewell">http://students.ubc.ca/livewell</a>.&nbsp;</p>
