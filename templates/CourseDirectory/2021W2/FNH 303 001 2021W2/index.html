<p><strong>Instructor’s Biographical Statement:</strong></p>
<p>My name is Dr. Anubhav Pratap-Singh, and I am a chemical engineer by education (BTech+MTech in Chemical Engineering from IIT Kharagpur in 2011), a software engineer by interest (acquired as the founder of two tech-service startups: Orangified and EstuMart), and a food scientist by training &amp; practice (PhD in 2015 from McGill University, postdoc from University of Toronto in 2016). I also worked with R&amp;D division of Enwave Inc., a UBC-spinoff company by UBC Food Science Professor Emeritus Dr. Tim Durance. In 2017, I joined UBC and setup the UBC Food Process Engineering Laboratory.</p>
<p>My main research focus on exploring novel approaches that: a) minimize deleterious effect of food processing on food quality &amp; nutrition, and b) overcome the biological barriers to absorption of nutritional components of food. Some of the major research directions in our laboratory include:</p>
<ol>
<li>developing non-thermal (pulsed light, ultrasound &amp; cold plasma) technologies for decontamination food products,</li>
<li>using extrusion &amp; other plant-based meat development technologies,</li>
<li>fortification of tea, salt &amp; other food products with multiple nutrients (iron, zinc, vitamin B, folic acid etc.) together,</li>
<li>developing buccal and sublingual sprays/tablets for delivery of insulin &amp; other bioceuticals orally bypassing GI tract</li>
<li>development of encapsulated rhACE2 for treating mild symptom CoVID-19 patients</li>
<li>upcycling of food industry wastes into value-added products, biodegradable &amp; packaging solutions for the food industry, &nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>In 2019, I received the Endowed Professorship in Food &amp; Beverage Innovation from the BC Ministry of Agriculture, Food &amp; Fisheries, as part of which I am coordinating the establishment of Food Hubs across the Province of British Columbia, with a central R&amp;D hub at the proposed UBC Food &amp; Beverage Innovation Center, that is expected to be operational by 2024. As part of my current responsibilities, I am the Undergraduate Academic Advisor for the Food, Nutrition and Health program, LFS Representative Senator 2020-23 to the UBC Vancouver Senate, Member of the UBC Academic Policy Committee, and the UBC Research &amp; Scholarship Committee, Privacy Officer of the St. James House Strata Council, UBC Representative to the Executive Board of the British Columbia Food Technologists (BCFT) Association, BC Representative to the Advisory Committee of the Canadian Institute of Food Science &amp; Technology (CIFST) Association, and Editorial Board Members for Elsevier's journal 'Applied Food Research' and Nature Publishing Group's journal 'Scientific Reports'. I am also currently writing a book on "Application of Microwaves in Foods".</p>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Course Objectives</h1>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>New product development is an integral part of the food industry. This course will introduce you to concepts in food product formulation and development. The function of various food additives, approaches to experimental design, and sensory evaluation will be addressed in lectures and applied in a theoretical case study.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Course Format and Activities</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The course will present lectures, activities and support materials that will introduce you to concepts used in food product development, with the overarching principle of food safety. These will be presented in 4 modules, and each module will be assessed with quizzes. The modules and concepts that will be covered are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction to Product Development
<ol>
<li>Concept development</li>
<li>Project management</li>
<li>Formulation</li>
<li>Shelf-life testing</li>
<li>Labelling</li>
<li>Sustainability</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Design of Experiment
<ol>
<li>Factorial, response surface and mixture designs</li>
<li>Selection of an appropriate experimental design</li>
<li>Evaluation and interpretation of statistical data</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Sensory Evaluation
<ol>
<li>Design of an appropriate evaluation - discriminative, descriptive, hedonic</li>
<li>Evaluation and interpretation of statistical data</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Additive roles, mechanisms, and properties
<ol>
<li>Stabilizers</li>
<li>Antimicrobials</li>
<li>Flavours</li>
<li>Colours</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All these concepts will be used to complete two group reports and a case study critique. Students, working in teams, will apply the concepts to their own reports and product development case. Teams will be given class time to develop their case. <em>It is expected that all students will participate in all sessions set aside for the group work.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The original format of the course is <strong>in-person classes</strong>, with the supporting materials for the course available on Canvas. In case some of the classes are moved online, recorded lectures will be made available online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cameras during class time for Online Classes: </strong>I strongly recommend that you remain visible on your camera during class time when there are group discussions or activities. This helps me and your TA to get to know you and remember you (in case you need a reference in the future!) and helps build a better sense of community with your class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>*Note: a peer factor of 20% will be used as for the case work component of the course. Each group member will distribute 200 points amongst group members, in proportion to their contribution to group work. The sum distributed to &nbsp;each group member will be a used to compute 4% of the total 20% weightage assigned to case study</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Late Assignment Policy</h1>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Due dates for assignments are clearly noted in the syllabus and in the assignments posted on Canvas. Late assignments will be accepted up to 3 days late, with a 10% mark penalty per day (i.e. an assignment handed in one day late will have 10% subtracted from the grade). If you anticipate having a problem meeting a deadline, please contact me to discuss the situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Quizzes</h1>
<p>Short (15 min) quizzes will be completed by each individual student on Canvas, online or in-class. These quizzes are <strong>open book</strong>, but must be completed without collaboration. The objective of this approach is to ensure that basic concepts are understood by all students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quizzes will be marked automatically and the marks posted on Canvas, but if you notice a problem with the marking, please contact your TA, who will review it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note – if you miss one quiz <em>for a valid reason</em>, the marks will be distributed to the remaining quizzes. A second missed quiz, without discussing with me <strong><u>prior</u> </strong>to the quiz, will be given a mark of 0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>If you run into a technical problem accessing a quiz on-line, please email me immediately </em></strong><strong><u><a href="mailto:anubhav.singh@ubc.ca">anubhav.singh@ubc.ca</a></u></strong></p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will be assigned to groups of ~7 students. You will apply the information from the course content in a <strong>THEORTICAL </strong>food product development case to simulate some of the issues that can arise during product development, and to practice and demonstrate your mastery of the course content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The product must include upcycling of a waste material as a sustainability element. </strong>Each group must select specific criteria for their product. The objective of the case study, may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>New product without a prototype in the market</li>
<li>Expansion of an existing product line</li>
<li>Match to a product already in the market</li>
<li>Another objective – please confirm with your Teaching Assistant</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please get feedback on your ideas from me or your teaching assistant. You can consider recent nutritional trends/topics or other trends that could impact food products (e.g. lifestyle issues; demographics). You may check IFT top 10 food trends or <a href="http://www.mintel.com/global-food-and-drink-trends/">http://www.mintel.com/global-food-and-drink-trends/ </a>for ideas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each group must complete the “Product Selection Worksheet” and submit on Canvas by Jan 20<sup>th</sup> 2022. The group needs to select their product and approach relatively quickly so that there will be enough time to research and develop the details of the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The group will write two reports for the case study. Details on what is required in each report are given below, and additional information is in the marking rubrics for each report posted on Canvas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> </strong><strong>Case Report #1: Draft (1%) + Final (4%): </strong>The first written report will detail:</li>

<h2>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Product Characterization 40%:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Clearly list the objective of the product development (if appropriate, how and why it will be improved or changed)</li>
<li>Describe the target market for your new product (demographic characteristics)</li>
<li>Describe any specific regulatory requirements/standards of identity for this product if they exist in For example, if you are proposing a low-fat version of an existing product, you need to specify the change in fat content required by the Canadian Food and Drug regulations that allow a product to be denoted as “low fat”</li>
<li>Describe all the ingredients of the product, with the function of If you are proposing to use any new food additives / ingredients in the product, including the function and rationale for selection of specific components (e.g. why the specific emulsifier or colour is most appropriate)</li>

<h1>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peer Evaluation (4%)</a></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will distribute 200 points amongst your group members, except yourself. Total points should not be more than 200 and no one student can get more than 60 points, else your score will not be counted and all your group members will receive default 200/(n-1) points (where n is the number of group members). You can allocate less than 200 points. Total score received by each group member will be divided by 5 to count towards 40 points (4% weightage of the course). Please note that over-contributors can get more than 100% marks in this scoring format, while those not contributing can get 0% marks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although, you will be dividing the marks as per your own impressions of the work-ethics of your group members, a sample marking scheme is denoted below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>1st Member Name - 51-60 most active and has the greatest contribution.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>2nd Member Name - 41-50 above average contribution</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>3rd Member Name - 31-40 average contribution</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>4th Member Name - 15-30 below average contribution</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">

</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>6th Member Name - 0 never showed up. Did not contribute at all</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Final exam</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that there is NO final exam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Mid-term exams I and II (30% each)</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The course will have 2 in-person mid-terms (that may have to transtition online for CoVID-protocol), each covering 2 modules and each having 30% weightage on Tuesday 15th February 2022 and Tuesday 22nd March 2022 respectively from 9:30-11:00am. If for some reason these dates don't work for you, please notify the instructor before the course-drop deadline, in order to seek accommodation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mid-Term Exam 1 will cover Modules 1 and 2, while Mid-Term Exam 2 will cover Modules 3 and 4. If the exams are in-person, they will be closed-book. If the exams are forced online due to CoVID, we will discuss about this in the class, with a strong probability of an open-book time-stressed exam. <strong><em>Failure to follow the expected guidelines with respect to academic honesty may result in disciplinary action. </em></strong>Questions will mainly be short answer type and will also include various types of questions (e.g. true/false, long and short-answer, match the following, fill in the blanks, short numericals, statistical data<strong><em> </em></strong>interpretation etc.). <strong>You cannot copy and paste material from any source, or re-type material directly from source as an answer to an exam question</strong>. You must compose answers in your own words. You will not need access to Minitab.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I recommend reviewing the Learning Outcomes from each lecture as a way to prepare for the exam</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong><em>If you run into a technical problem during the exam, please email me immediately </em></strong><a href="mailto:Christine.scaman@ubc.ca"><strong><em>anubhav.singh@ubc.ca</em></strong></a></p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Learning Analytics</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Learning analytics includes the collection and analysis of data about learners to improve teaching and learning. This course will be using the following learning technologies: Canvas. This tool captures data about your activity and provide information that can be used to improve the quality of teaching and learning. In this course, I plan to use analytics data to:</p>
<ul>
<li>View overall class progress</li>
<li>Review statistics on course content being accessed to support improvements in the course</li>
<li>Monitor adherence to academic integrity by applying analytics on quizzes, assignments and on-line exams.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. All UBC students are expected to behave as honest and responsible members of an academic community. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is the student's obligation to learn, understand and follow the standards for academic honesty. Students must be aware that standards at the University of British Columbia may be different from those in secondary schools or at other institutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Violations of academic integrity lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious actions are taken. Plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on an assignment, exam, or course. More serious</p>
<p>consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Academic misconduct may result in a one-year suspension from the University and a notation of academic discipline on the student's record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://guides.library.ubc.ca/tutorial-lfs/citing/plagiarism">UBC library </a>has a useful Academic Integrity website that explains what plagiarism is and how to avoid it. If a student is in any doubt as to the standard of academic honesty in a particular course or assignment, then the student must consult with the instructor as soon as possible. A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3%2C54%2C111%2C958">Academic Calendar.</a> All course work may be submitted to Turnitin.com for review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>University Policies</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details of the policies and how to access support are available on <a href="https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success"><strong>the UBC Senate website</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
