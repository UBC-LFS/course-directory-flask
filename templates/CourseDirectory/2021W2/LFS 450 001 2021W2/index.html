<h2>Land Acknowledgement</h2>
<p>The Faculty of Land and Food Systems exists on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓-speaking xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) people. &nbsp;The University of British Columbia’s “Point Grey” Campus in English, is land claimed by the British as a Colonial Admiralty reserve in the mid-nineteenth century and occupied by the UBC since 1914. These lands have been sites of learning for many generations before UBC stood here, and have their own Musqueam names. I recognize that that as teachers, learners, researchers and individuals we have obligations to ensure the work carried out throughout our course ensures that we not only acknowledge but also work towards upholding and understanding more about this important relationship and help realize the commitments in UBC’s Indigenous Strategic Plan, and the Musqueam-UBC Memorandum of Affiliation, and we practice active dedication to more just and accountable relations and practices.</p>
<h2>Course Rationale</h2>
<p>Land, food and community are central components of all societies. Current trends of urbanization, globalization, high cost of living and fast pace of life are correlated with an increasing disconnect between citizens and the food systems that sustain us.&nbsp; The study of interactions between land, food and community within our society can offer insights into problems generated by this disconnect and provide strategies aimed at solving them.&nbsp; LFC III allows students to exercise leadership and employ skills acquired in previous Land, Food and Community or other specialization courses to address applied food system sustainability issues in the UBC-Vancouver campus.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>LFS 450 (Land, Food, and Community III) uses an applied learning, team-based approach with students to gain knowledge and skills to critically examine <em>and </em>actively advance food system sustainability challenges. It offers students the opportunity to apply skills and concepts derived from earlier coursework, experience, and areas of specialization to address contemporary challenges in an integrative, interdisciplinary setting. The central theme of this course is the envisioning, planning, implementation and evaluation of projects aimed at enhancing the ecological, economic and social sustainability of the campus food system. &nbsp;Opportunities will be provided throughout the course for students to critically examine food-related academic literature and food system issues experienced in the UBC-Vancouver Campus and broader regional and global contexts.</p>
<h2>Course Philosophy</h2>
<p>LFS 450, like all the courses in the LFC series, is a course based on a “community-of- learners” approach with important elements of Problem-Based Learning or the use of real world problems in the discovery and application of knowledge. One of the primary underlying assumptions in the “community-of-learners” approach is that the diversity within our classroom is a precious learning resource available to the teaching team and students.&nbsp; In this class, there are people with very diverse strengths, professional and cultural backgrounds: students coming from a plurality of ethno-cultural origins, belonging to the various academic degree programs both in the Faculty of Land and Food Systems and in other Faculties and with a variety of personal and professional experiences and expertise.&nbsp; This diversity can present challenges but is a precious resource and the dynamics of difference – under conditions of safety and respect – open up new and richer vistas to any subject matter. The Community-Based Action Research approach allows students to learn outside of the classroom and apply project management tools, discipline-specific and integrated discipline knowledge toward the resolution of community-based problems.</p>
<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>Upon completion of LFC III, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify personal values, strengths, conflict styles and leadership attributes</li>
<li>Identify and critically evaluate food system sustainability issues</li>
<li>Plan and initiate activities that can affect positive change towards food system sustainability and alleviating the interconnected climate, nature, human health and wellbeing crises</li>
<li>Apply principles of Community-Based Action Research</li>
<li>Apply principles of whole systems approaches</li>
<li>Demonstrate proficiency in conducting secondary and primary research</li>
<li>Gain and apply leadership skills</li>
<li>Demonstrate competence in project management skills and applications</li>
<li>Communicate effectively and professionally in written and verbal form with various audiences, ranging from non-academic to academic food system practitioners and affiliated community members</li>
</ul>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">Practitioner Literature Review – Food Issue: Individual Work (25%)</span></h2>
<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>As an emerging graduate in the workplace, you will likely be asked to provide an overview of a topic to inform decision making before you can commence work on a given project. Work environments are increasingly characterized by team-based work cultures, comprised of members possessing a diversity of specializations, knowledge and experiences.&nbsp; More often than not you will be asked to provide an overview of a topic to an audience broader than your supervisor, such as a team made up of a diversity of stakeholders who may or may not have content matter expertise or experience in the topic. As such, you must become comfortable in communication styles that are accessible for diversity of audiences. You must also be able to get up to speed sufficiently enough to demonstrate a solid understanding of a topic, including identifying issues, applicable and leading policies and practices that can provide direction on next steps to take, whether it is informing a decision or other practices.</p>
<p>Your practitioner literature review will serve a few purposes. It will provide an opportunity for you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Situate at least one issue associated with your group project within broader policy and practitioner contexts</li>
<li>Showcase your ability to find and articulate relationships between an issue and relevant policies &amp; practices&nbsp;</li>
<li>Demonstrate your understanding of an issue</li>
<li>Practice writing in straightforward, practical and accessible language</li>
<li>Do a "deep dive" of an issue independently, and at the same time provide you an opportunity to draw on this independent work to inform your group assignment (e.g. your approach, literature review, promising practice/environmental scan review, recommendations, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;">UBC Food System Sustainability Project: &nbsp;Group Work (Total 60% - see breakdown below)</span></h2>
<h3>Overview &amp; Requirements for Assignment Participation</h3>
<h4>The UBC Food System Sustainability Project is a key group assignment in the course that involves undertaking applied research. You will take on a researcher role in this assignment. The UBC’s Office of Research Services (ORS) requires all researchers conducting <u>in-person</u> research to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19, and you will need to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 in order to conduct in-person research as part of LFS 450. Vaccine requirements for in-person research are in place across the university to ensure researcher, research participants and general public safety. If you are not fully vaccinated, we will consider alternate online/virtual research options, which can be accommodated (e.g. instead of conducting an in-person interview you can conduct the interview via a phone call). If you have any considerations please let your instructor know, and we will follow up with you, and seek additional guidance as needed from and the UBC’s Behavioural Research Ethics Board&nbsp;(BREB) office as needed.</h4>
<h3>Assignment Components</h3>
<ol>
<li>Project Proposal</li>
<li>Interim Presentation</li>
<li>Final Presentation</li>
<li>Final Report</li>
</ol>
<h3>Project Audiences</h3>
<p>Your project has multiple audiences.&nbsp; The first, and most important, consists of your clients with whom the Community-Based Action Research is being conducted. Your project clients are responsible for reviewing your work and considering the potential for your findings and recommendations to affect their decision making, practices and policy implementation or formation. The second audience is Campus + Community Planning’s SEEDS Sustainability Program, who are responsible for following up on your report with the project clients as well as other relevant stakeholders, including various sustainability committees and policy representatives to determine implementation potential of your findings and recommendations, and opportunities for further research and action. The third audience is the teaching team who will evaluate your work and make recommendations for publication. The fourth audience is the general public who will have access to your report if it is published.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">UBC Food System Sustainability Project: Proposal (15%)</span></h2>
<p>Your group will be responsible for developing a formal Project Proposal. It is expected that you will work on the proposal and get approval from your clients and instructor prior to commencing any primary data collection. Well-written proposals are key to a successful project and are an integral component of project management. This is an opportunity for your group to practice writing a formal project<strong> </strong>proposal, gain feedback to ensure that you are on the right track, and get approval from your course instructor on your proposed research methods. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As a "researcher" conducting research affiliated with UBC, each group member is required to complete online training, including the <a href="https://ethics.research.ubc.ca/education-training/online-tutorials-training">Tri-Council Policy Statement (TCPS) 2 2018 tutorial Course in Research Ethics (CORE)</a>, and submit your&nbsp;Certificate of Completion through Canvas&nbsp;PRIOR to conducting any data collection</p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">UBC Food System Sustainability Project: Interim Presentation (5%)</span></h2>
<p>Your group will be responsible for conducting an interim presentation <em>before</em> your final presentation. The objective of this presentation is to provide you with an opportunity to practice professional communication in front of your peers, gain preliminary feedback on both content and presentation style prior to your final presentation and submission of your final report.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">UBC Food System Sustainability Project: Final Presentation (10%) and Report (30%)</span></h2>
<p>Knowledge exchange involves both the translation and mobilization of knowledge. The culmination of your group work will result in a formal final report and presentation.</p>
<p>The final presentation is an opportunity to verbally translate your work in a visually engaging way with the class, project clients, and other invited campus stakeholders. Sharing your findings and recommendations will provide a critical opportunity for you to inform decision making and actions with your client group(s) and other stakeholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final group report serves as your final project communication deliverable. It will serve as your most significant opportunity in the course to comprehensively convey your Community-Based Action Research project with your clients, teaching team and the general public. Your report will be considered for publication (pending quality) on the <a href="https://sustain.ubc.ca/teaching-applied-learning/seeds-sustainability-program">SEEDS Sustainability Library</a> and <a href="http://circle.ubc.ca/">UBC cIRcle Digital Repository</a>.&nbsp; The SEEDS Sustainability Library is the most frequently visited page on the UBC Sustainability website and is referenced from other peer institutions and practitioners all over the world to inform their practices and publications. You will have the opportunity to cite this project on your resume and in interviews. This publication can serve as a formal public record that you can reference as an example of your experience conducting applied Community-Based Action Research, experience with research design and various mixed research methods, working with diverse stakeholders, engaging in full project management life-cycle, and ideally your ability to produce demonstrable results, such as mobilizing research in ways that can inform decision-making, practices, and policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>All affiliated project documents must be submitted upon report due date, including: 1) submitting consent forms as a separate file to your course instructor, and 2) submitting data, data collection tools (interview and focus group scripts, questionnaires, etc.), recruitment tools (advertisements to participate in a focus group, questionnaire, etc.), and any other work generated (e.g. guideline, strategy,&nbsp; inventory, etc.) in your report appendices.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;">UBC Food System Sustainability Project: Peer Reviews (mandatory)&nbsp; </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</h2>
<p>While group work can be rewarding it can be challenging and unequally shared. &nbsp;Your TA and instructor will monitor your group to assist groups that are experiencing challenges. Similar to other professional environments, if any group member is experiencing team issues please do be proactive and approach the teaching team to report an issue that you would like advice or other support on how to resolve. At the end of the course, each student will submit a confidential peer evaluation via an iPeer form on Canvas within 24 hours of the&nbsp;final group report submission, required to obtain participation points.</p>
<p>The peer review is a confidential evaluation of your group members, and the purpose is for you to assess and assign a “multiplier value” to each of your group members (yourself included). This value is determined according to an honest, respectful and reflective account of your personal experience with each member as you worked together on group projects throughout the course. Factors to consider include, but are not limited to, the level of participation and contribution to the progress of group work, a person’s ability to be a team player, the ability to lead and coordinate the group’s efforts or someone’s ability to resolve conflict.</p>
<p>The peer evaluation uses a “multiplier value” that works to reward those that helped to make the team work effectively, and penalize those that impeded the group’s progress because of their behaviour, lack of interest or genuine effort. The values you may choose are 0 to 1.1. The value of 1.0 means that a person contributed equally to the group effort and deserves the full marks for your group’s projects through the term. Members who did extra work or worked especially well could receive up to 1.1; members who did less should receive less than 1.0, in proportion to the amount of work or quality of work they contributed.</p>
<p>The teaching team will use these scores to determine a final multiplier for the proposal, interim and final presentations, and final report.</p>
