<p><strong>Instructor’s Biographical Statement:</strong></p>
<p>My name is Dr. Anubhav Pratap-Singh, and I am a chemical engineer by education (BTech+MTech in Chemical Engineering from IIT Kharagpur in 2011), a software engineer by interest (acquired as the founder of two tech-service startups: Orangified and EstuMart), and a food scientist by training &amp; practice (PhD in 2015 from McGill University, postdoc from University of Toronto in 2016). I also worked with R&amp;D division of Enwave Inc., a UBC-spinoff company by UBC Food Science Professor Emeritus Dr. Tim Durance. In 2017, I joined UBC and setup the UBC Food Process Engineering Laboratory.</p>
<p>My main research focus on exploring novel approaches that: a) minimize deleterious effect of food processing on food quality &amp; nutrition, and b) overcome the biological barriers to absorption of nutritional components of food. Some of the major research directions in our laboratory include:</p>
<ol>
<li>developing non-thermal (pulsed light, ultrasound &amp; cold plasma) technologies for decontamination food products,</li>
<li>using extrusion &amp; other plant-based meat development technologies,</li>
<li>fortification of tea, salt &amp; other food products with multiple nutrients (iron, zinc, vitamin B, folic acid etc.) together,</li>
<li>developing buccal and sublingual sprays/tablets for delivery of insulin &amp; other bioceuticals orally bypassing GI tract</li>
<li>development of encapsulated rhACE2 for treating mild symptom CoVID-19 patients</li>
<li>upcycling of food industry wastes into value-added products, biodegradable &amp; packaging solutions for the food industry, &nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>In 2019, I received the Endowed Professorship in Food &amp; Beverage Innovation from the BC Ministry of Agriculture, Food &amp; Fisheries, as part of which I am coordinating the establishment of Food Hubs across the Province of British Columbia, with a central R&amp;D hub at the proposed UBC Food &amp; Beverage Innovation Center, that is expected to be operational by 2024. As part of my current responsibilities, I am the Undergraduate Academic Advisor for the Food, Nutrition and Health program, LFS Representative Senator 2020-23 to the UBC Vancouver Senate, Member of the UBC Academic Policy Committee, and the UBC Research &amp; Scholarship Committee, Privacy Officer of the St. James House Strata Council, UBC Representative to the Executive Board of the British Columbia Food Technologists (BCFT) Association, BC Representative to the Advisory Committee of the Canadian Institute of Food Science &amp; Technology (CIFST) Association, and Editorial Board Members for Elsevier's journal 'Applied Food Research' and Nature Publishing Group's journal 'Scientific Reports'. I am also currently writing a book on "Application of Microwaves in Foods".</p>

<p><strong>Course Objective </strong></p>
<p>The course is structured to cover the physical, chemical and microbiological basis of the various methods of food processing/preservation with special reference to thermal processing, freezing, dehydration and other novel processing method. Thermal processing section<span>&nbsp;covers everything from historical perspectives to classification and principles of thermal processing, concepts of lethality and resistance to microorganisms, simple process calculations, and a brief discussion of a wide variety of equipment used commercially. This chapter also covers quality aspects of thermally processed foods.&nbsp;</span>Food freezing section&nbsp;<span>covers refrigerated storage, food freezing and thawing, the quality and stability of frozen foods, simple mathematical models for the calculation of freezing and thawing times and a discussion of equipment.&nbsp;</span> Food Dehydration section<span>&nbsp;</span><span>detail the principles and practices involved in successful production of high quality frozen/dried foods and covers basic concepts as equilibrium moisture content, water activity, drying kinetics, psychrometry, drying time caclulations and some novel drying technique. Apart from this, knowledge about other processing approaches such as&nbsp;</span> separation &amp; concentration operations <span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span> food packaging<span>&nbsp;not covered directly through the course will be accumulated through self-study modules. In last part of the course, a flipped-classroom approach will be used to provide introduction to&nbsp;</span>Emerging novel processing technologies<span>&nbsp;finding usage in food preservation. Each student (in groups of ~7) will be involved in preparation &amp; delivery of a lecture on any Novel Processing Approach to peers, and complete a group assignment &amp; individual quiz on the topics covered by the individual groups on the last day of the class.</span></p>
<p>By the end of this course, students should be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Describe </strong>the science (mechanism of action), history, importance, benefits and disadvantages of various processing approaches commonly applied in food industry.</li>
<li><strong>Select </strong>appropriate mathematical models and <strong>Calculate</strong> important food processing parameters in order to <strong>Design</strong> an industrial food process.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluate</strong> the destruction kinetics of a pathogen (or other biological entities) and <strong>Suggest </strong>the minimum time required at a particular temperature for complete death of that microorganism.</li>
<li><strong>Construct </strong>the heat penetration curve from a time-temperature data, and <strong>Calculate</strong> the process lethality of a particular process or process time to achieve a particular lethality using various general and formula methods.</li>

<p><strong>Additional Notes </strong></p>
<p><strong>Academic accommodations will be made in accordance with university policies. Students requiring accommodations should notify the instructor as soon as possible.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The instructor reserves the right to deviate from the syllabus as needed. Students requesting an exception to the syllabus must submit the request via email to the instructor.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Learning Analytics</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Learning analytics includes the collection and analysis of data about learners to improve teaching and learning. This course will be using the following learning technologies: Canvas. This tool captures data about your activity and provide information that can be used to improve the quality of teaching and learning. In this course, I plan to use analytics data to:</p>
<ul>
<li>View overall class progress</li>
<li>Review statistics on course content being accessed to support improvements in the course</li>
<li>Monitor adherence to academic integrity by applying analytics on quizzes, assignments and on-line exams.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong></p>
<p>The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. All UBC students are expected to behave as honest and responsible members of an academic community. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work.</p>
<p>It is the student's obligation to learn, understand and follow the standards for academic honesty. Students must be aware that standards at the University of British Columbia may be different from those in secondary schools or at other institutions.</p>
<p>Violations of academic integrity lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious actions are taken. Plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on an assignment, exam, or course. More serious</p>
<p>consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Academic misconduct may result in a one-year suspension from the University and a notation of academic discipline on the student's record.</p>
<p>The<span>&nbsp;</span>UBC Library has a useful Academic Integrity website that explains what plagiarism is and how to avoid it. If a student is in any doubt as to the standard of academic honesty in a particular course or assignment, then the student must consult with the instructor as soon as possible. A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Academic Calendar.</span><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline" title="Links to an external site."><span class="screenreader-only">Links to an external site.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>All course work may be submitted to Turnitin.com for review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>University Policies</strong></p>
<p>UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
