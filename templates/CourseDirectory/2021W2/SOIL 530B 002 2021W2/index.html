<p><strong>SOIL 530 – SOIL RECLAMATION AND REMEDIATION</strong><br><strong>WINTER 2022 - TERM 2 SYLLABUS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Instructor</strong><br>Autumn Watkinson, PhD<br>Postdoctoral Teaching Fellow<br>Faculty of Land and Food Systems<br>University of British Columbia<br>Email Address: autumn.watkinson@ubc.ca<br>Office Hours: By appointment over Zoom</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Course</strong></p>
<p>SOIL 530 is a directed study course in which the student is required to complete readings, assignments, and an individual research project outside of a formal class setting. The individual research project will be library-based (literature review or meta-analysis). The research project will be within the field of soil reclamation (restoration, rehabilitation) and/or remediation, with a specific focus requiring approval of the instructor. This course will require students to apply knowledge from previous courses and experiences and to use critical thinking and judgment in the application of theory and principles. The course will focus on the application of principles, practices, and philosophies of soil reclamation and remediation, with emphasis on ecological services and sustainability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>• Understand, synthesize and apply knowledge of ecological systems to reclaim (restore, rehabilitate) and remediate soils to appropriate functional standards</p>
<p>• Identify the causes of soil degradation and understand the challenges associated with each disturbance type</p>
<p>• Understand the ecological consequences of soil degradation and learn how to address them through reclamation and remediation</p>
<p>• Understand and apply soil reclamation and remediation principles and theories and critically evaluate common practices from different perspectives.</p>
<p>• Learn to correctly use soil and reclamation lexicon, terms, and definitions.</p>
<p>• Develop a research paper on a given topic within the field of soil reclamation and remediation</p>
<p>• Clearly and professionally compose logical, concise and grammatically correct written works and convey knowledge, opinions, and ideas to intended audiences</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Classes</strong></p>
<p>There will be no in-person lectures for this course. There will be some supplemental lectures delivered online (via Zoom). Class meetings will occur every other week to discuss assigned readings and will be scheduled at a time that is agreeable to the instructor and students. For Winter 2022 semester 2, classes are every Thursday at 13:00 PST.&nbsp; In the second half of the semester, students will meet individually (online) with the instructor, at least every other week to discuss their research papers and provide progress reports. Assignments will be delivered and submitted online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Attendance Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Students are required to attend and participate in all scheduled meetings. The instructor will send out calendar invites to all meetings and will send a reminder 24 hr before the meeting is scheduled. If you are unable to attend a meeting due to illness or any other extenuating circumstances, please email the instructor as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Professionalism And Rules Of Engagement</strong></p>
<p>Please be on time for scheduled meetings. If being late is unavoidable, please advise the instructor via email as soon as possible. Students must silence their cellular phones and close social media connections during meetings. Do not have other applications open during meetings, other than course-related documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>References And Readings</strong></p>
<p>Specific readings may be provided throughout the term. Required readings will be clearly designated. Refereed journal literature, government reports, and industrial and consulting reports will help students gather information for their research paper. Students are encouraged to use all available reference sources, not just the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Plagiarism And Cheating</strong></p>
<p>Lack of knowledge is not a defense for plagiarism and cheating. Plagiarism: no student shall submit the words, ideas, images, or data of another person as the student’s own in any academic writing, essay, thesis, project, assignment, presentation, or poster in a course or program of study. Cheating: no student shall represent another’s substantial editorial or compositional assistance on an assignment as the student’s own work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Grading</strong></p>
<p>Progress reports 10 % (2 % each)</p>
<p>Assignments 30 %&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participation - Colleague points 5 %</p>
<p>Final Presentation 10 %</p>
<p>Final Paper 45 %</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Progress Reports</strong></p>
<p>Progress reports will be submitted to the instructor via Canvas as Assignments &nbsp; with the name "Progress Report 1", "Progress Report 2", etc. Progress reports are used as a way for students to plan out their final paper over the semester and receive feedback from the instructor along the way. Details about what to include in each progress report will be included in each assignment description. There will be 5 progress reports; each progress report is worth 2 % of the student's final grade.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Assignments</strong></p>
<p>Assignments will be delivered and submitted via Canvas as  Assignments. There will be at least 3 assignments delivered through out the semester, each worth 10 % or less of the student's final grade.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Participation - Colleague Points</strong></p>
<p>Students are encouraged to keep their cameras on during the class to encourage discussion. As the class size is small, students are welcome to raise their hand (using the Zoom emoji) or turn on their microphone and ask questions (respectfully) through lectures, class discussion, etc. Participation traditionally recorded as discussion in class is not marked but encouraged.</p>
<p>Colleague Points will be awarded up to 10 % of the student's final grade. The following tasks can be awarded colleague points:</p>
<p>- time keeping/chairing lectures or discussions (1 student per session). </p>
<p>- note taking for the class/discussion. The student will email the instructor their notes and the instructor will then compile all student notes for the class and post them under the module. All notes will be kept anonymous on Canvas (i.e. your name will not be attached to your notes and you will receive a grade from the instructor for your effort which will not be displayed to others)</p>
<p>- summarizing what we learned the previous week at the start of the lecture</p>
<p>- any form of mutual aid (proofreading a peer's paper, suggesting papers/materials for our Canvas library, providing feedback to the instructor on a lecture, submitting a learning activity that you would like to do in class, etc.)</p>
<p>- volunteering to give a mini-presentation/summary of a topic that you read about and wanted to share with the class (excludes assigned/discussion group papers)</p>
<p>- submitting a PDF/paper that is annotated for fellow students (excluded assigned/discussion group papers).</p>
<p>- other: do something that helps your peers that this list did not anticipate!</p>
<p>In all cases (except note-taking and timekeeping, students should email the instructor to alter them of their proposed plan to achieve colleague points) Example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;"Hello Autumn/Dr Watkinson (whichever the student is comfortable using),</p>
<p>I would like to submit an annotated PDF for the class. The name of the paper is TITLE, and I think it's relevant to the class because REASONS (list or summarize - this will be sent to the class as a description of the paper). Please find attached.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>STUDENT NAME"</p>
<p><strong>Final Presentation</strong></p>
<p>The final presentation will summarize the student's final paper and will be no more than 6 minutes in length.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FINAL PAPER</strong></p>
<p>Topic: will be within the realm of soil remediation and/or reclamation and will be discussed and approved by instructor. The topic should be focused and specific (ex. “Soil reclamation of agricultural land” is not acceptable but “Soil reclamation of saline well sites in southern Alberta” is more focused).</p>
<p>Length: at least 5 pages of text (~ 1,600 words), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">excluding</span> the title page, figures, tables, or references. 11-12 pt, standard font (Calibri, Arial, Times New Roman) at 1.5 line spacing. Maximum length 10 pages of text length plus title page, figures, tables and references.</p>
<p>Content: describe the overall topic that you have chosen, and why it is important to the field, and why we as a global population should care about it. The standard form should follow a literature review style, but this is open for discussion if students want to develop an issues paper or include a small meta-analysis. Case studies can be included to highlight important aspects of the paper but should not make up the bulk of the paper. As a literature review format, we are interested in summarizing the current knowledge on the topic into appropriate subheadings, and relate those ideas to why they are important from a reclamation perspective, how the topic impacts reclamation (how it relates to reclamation practices or how it’s employed in the field) and when it might be an issue we should think about when conducting reclamation/remediation. Knowledge gaps should be identified, and suggestions to fill those gaps should be provided. Please see the Canvas Page on the Final Paper for more details.</p>
