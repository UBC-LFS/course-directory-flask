<p><strong>LEARNING ACTIVITIES</strong></p>
<p>Some outdoor self-directed activities in class may require working in small groups; assigned reading must be completed before class meetings. In addition, <strong>you should submit any discussion questions before the meeting</strong>. There will be one or two flexible learning sessions, no class meeting, where students will need to complete an outdoor assignment and report to the class later. Depending on COVID-19 restrictions and weather conditions, we will organize class meetings at the UBC farm Indigenous garden. Class participation is graded, expected, and highly encouraged.</p>
<p><strong>LEARNING MATERIALS</strong></p>
<p>There is no required textbook for this course; links to assigned reading material will be available with each module posted on Canvas. Canvas will be used as the central online learning management system. You may be asked to visit or directed to other online resources if necessary.</p>

<li><strong>Academic and Self-Reflective Essay</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In a short essay format, you will be required to answer the provided questions. The essay should include course content covered up to the previous session of the due date. The academic portion of the essay will be based on required readings, guest speakers (if applicable), videos and class content presented by your instructors. The self-reflective piece should demonstrate your personal growth from a significant experience (s). It is not a summary of other people's thoughts but your own opinion.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Out-of-Class Project (UBC Museum of Anthropology)</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Photo Essay</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The photo essay can be on any topic you choose. However, it must tell a story, be of interest to a general audience, and relate to the course's issues. All images must be original and photographed by the student for this assignment. Pictures taken before the project are not allowed.</p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Story Analysis and Cultural Identity Essay</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Based on a selected Indigenous story, write a 1200-word response that demonstrates and supports your response to the story by linking other ideas and concepts, describes opinions and emotions to the story's message, generates conclusions using analyses and evidence, and suggests contextual connections and relationships. Reflective writing is more personal than other types of academic writing; think mindfully about the message offered in the story and what it means to you, and the process of learning or practicing in your professional career.</p>
<p>Try to identify literary devices such as allusion and metaphor and explain their purpose in the story. Make connections, interpret, and draw conclusions to Indigenous worldviews. Discuss any ethical implications, issues, or conflicts identified in the What does the story's title mean? How does it relate to the topics addressed in the course? Would you tell the story from a different perspective? Does the story relate to your own experience or culture? What are the teachings embedded in the story?

<li><strong>Journal Log Response (4 entries)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Each student will keep a journal of the course. The complete <strong>journals</strong> are due at the end of the term. The journal may be any notebook where papers are already attached or into which you may attach loose documents. It would be best to write about ideas relevant to the class/topic/course. A large part of your journal grade will depend on whether you create a synthesis of the course information. If references are made, you must properly cite them. No two people in the class should have the same story written in their journals.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Participation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Your enthusiasm, involvement, and active participation affect the quality of class discussion, the learning environment, and your final grade. We strive to create a supportive environment for the students. Take this opportunity to share your thoughts and knowledge. It will help you build confidence and prepare you for future professions.</p>
