<p>Upon completion of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe colloidal dispersions important to food quality and sensory perception</li>
<li>Describe the role of chemical reactions, enzymes and microorganisms in food spoilage, food preservation and food-borne disease</li>
<li>Describe food processing/preservation methods and packaging systems, including their application in the conversion of raw materials into food products</li>
<li>Develop personal food selection and food handling habits that will minimize risk of contracting foodborne or water-borne disease</li>
<li>Articulate a personal set of values related to your decisions pertaining to selection of food products for both your personal and your family's consumption</li>

<h1><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Course Evaluation</strong></span></h1>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong></span></p>
<p>Academic honesty is a core value of scholarship. Cheating and plagiarism (including both presenting the work of others as your own and self-plagiarism), are serious academic offenses that are taken very seriously in Land &amp; Food Systems. By registering for courses at UBC, students have initiated a contract with the university that they will abide by the rules of the institution. It is the<u> student’s responsibility to inform themselves of the University regulations</u>.</p>
<p>Definitions of Academic Misconduct and plagiarism can be found on the following websites:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.library.ubc.ca/home/plagiarism/"><strong><u>http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,959http://www.library.ubc.ca/home/plagiarism/</u></strong></a></p>
