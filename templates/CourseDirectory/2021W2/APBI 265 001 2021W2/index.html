<p><strong>Land Acknowledgement</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>UBC’s Point Grey Campus is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xwməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam) people. The land it is situated on has always been a place of learning for the Musqueam people, who for millennia have passed on their culture, history, and traditions from one generation to the next on this site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>APBI265 is a blended course, and I am grateful to be instructing this course both on campus, and virtually, from the place where I call home that stands within the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territories of the <a href="https://native-land.ca/">Hul’qumi’num Treaty Group</a>. Many indigenous peoples thrive on the lands and waters we are acknowledging and are alive and strong.</p>

<p><strong>Course Instructor Brief Biographical Statement</strong></p>
<p>I am an Assistant Professor in the Applied Biology Program of the Faculty of Land and Food Systems with a part-time appointment. I have been teaching courses focused on Agroecology and Food Systems in our faculty since 2009. This course emerged from my graduate research and from my years as lead instructor for the UBC Farm Practicum in Sustainable Agriculture. My areas of research and farming practice are focused on soil health centered best practices with an agroecological lens. I am also a full-time farmer living and working my family’s 40-acre farm on Vancouver Island. My research collaborations with the Sustainable Agriculture Landscapes Lab and Dr. Sean Smukler connect our farm with a wider network of regionally focused on-farm investigations.</p>

<p><strong><u>Course Description</u></strong></p>
<p>APBI265</p>
<p>The question: <em>'How do we feed the world'</em> dominated the restructuring of agricultural policy and farming landscapes in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, and continues to drive much of the debate around farming and food systems today. This course is built on a foundation of the science, practice, and social movements of Agroecology, and provides a critical evaluation of the ‘feed the world’ approach. With student-centered and team-based learning, we explore emerging questions framed by contemporary Agroecologists, including: '<em>how do we feed ourselves'</em> and '<em>how do we make meaningful change to farming and food system</em>s' with a view towards greater equity, diversity, and inclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>APBI265 introduces Agroecology as an approach to redesigning agriculture and food systems.</p>
<p><strong><em>Agroecology offers a set of practices,&nbsp;built on a foundation of science, energized by social movements that can move us towards sustainable agriculture and food systems in the 21st century.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In pursuit of directly engaging with agriculture and food systems challenges, students enrolled in APBI265 will be responsible for taking the initiative to communicate safely in person and/or virtually with their peers, with practicing farmers, food systems activists, and with their instructor as key activities and connections to course learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Course Structure</u></strong></p>
<p>Pending any further changes to Public Health orders, for this term (2021W2) APBI265 will be delivered as a blended course with scheduled on campus classroom meeting sessions, virtual classroom sessions, and small peer group in-person or virtual meeting sessions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building communication skills and continued practice with collaborative and social learning are important learning objectives of the course and will require flexibility and coordination of your schedule. You will be asked to regularly contribute to discussions, to respectfully provide timely peer review, engagement, and feedback as part of the course learning assessment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Course readings and all assignments will all be located within the APBI265 Canvas course website. Students will need to familiarize themselves with how to navigate the site, where and how to submit each assignment, and take responsibility for communicating regularly with classmates and the instructor.</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Course Schedule</u></strong></p>
<p>The schedule for the course will be organized on a weekly basis, with scheduled synchronous classroom sessions and all written assignments due on Wednesdays (Vancouver campus time zone as reference P.S.T.). A detailed weekly course schedule can be found on the APBI265 home page in Canvas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the regularly scheduled classroom session time on Wednesdays (beginning at 1 pm (PST)), I will offer brief lectures to highlight key terms, concepts, and controversies and in turn, support your connections with our course learning objectives. &nbsp;Students will engage in discussion with the whole class, in tutorial sessions, and in smaller group break-out discussions. I will also answer your questions related to the course and assignments and facilitate a range of other participatory learning activities that will factor into a portion of your marks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we hold student led or group discussions, or host guest lectures during this classroom meeting time, we may require the full 1-4 pm (PST) time slot that is scheduled for us in FNH50. The confirmed example of this at this time will be the very final in-class meeting date, April 6, when our classroom session will be filled with presentations of your final project assignments. The guest lecture schedule for the term is yet to be confirmed. I will post an announcement and a schedule update to notify students when (in addition to that April 6 date) an in-person or virtual meeting Wednesday would require the full 1-4 pm (PST) time slot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For most of the 10 weeks we are currently scheduled for in-person and on-campus synchronous sessions, we will complete the lectures and in-class learning activities by 3 p.m. and the remaining time will be yours to join me for an office hour, informal Q&amp;A, for completing an assignment on your own, or for meeting with your student group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Immediately following the scheduled classroom session, I will host an ‘office hour’ for one-on-one questions. For students who are living outside of the Vancouver campus area or who are unable to attend an in-person and on-campus classroom session, we will offer alternatives that may include recorded classroom sessions, or web lectures, alternate asynchronous learning activities, and/or virtual office hours. Please contact me by email with this type of request or accommodation: <a href="mailto:delisa.lewis@ubc.ca">delisa.lewis@ubc.ca</a><u>&nbsp; (APBI265 in subject line)</u></p>
<p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<p>Any change to the course schedule will be communicated with Canvas Course Announcements and an updated version of the course schedule will be posted on the corresponding Canvas course page.</p>

<p>See the Weekly Course Schedule linked on the Canvas home page and the Assignments tab link on left side navigation in Canvas for complete list of due dates, detailed assignment instructions, and marking rubrics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The accepted format for all written assignments is the American Psychological Association (APA) format.&nbsp;<u>You are expected to follow this format for all written assignments. </u></strong>In brief, the APA writing style aims to promote objectivity in communicating science, and the APA format is a means to standardize reports across the scientific community (Schwartz, Landrum, &amp; Guring, 2013). More detailed information about this format, including how to cite references correctly can be found&nbsp;here <u>Links to an external site.</u>&nbsp;and&nbsp;here<u>&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</u>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MultiMedia presentation and/or experiential learning assignment is intended to offer an opportunity to demonstrate that students have met key course learning objectives with reflections, inspiration, and communication forms that include other ways of learning and knowing. If Public Health Orders permit, and we are able to meet in person and on-campus for the final Wednesday of the term, April 6, this assignment will take the form of an oral presentation with your student group. Alternate possibilities for this assignment may include MultiMedia submissions that are image only or audio-visual recordings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Canvas assignment dropbox has limitations for accepted file format type and file size that sets the expectations for acceptable submissions of this assignment.</strong> The details for acceptable file formats and file size for this assignment will be found in the MultiMedia /experiential learning assignment description, linked with the Assignments tab on the course Canvas site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Contacting the instructor and office hours</u></strong></p>
<p>If you have general questions about the course content or assignments, please first post these to the Canvas course <u>Frequently Asked Questions/FAQS Discussion</u> Board. On the FAQS discussion board, anyone in the course may helpfully respond—another student, the instructor, or your TA. Please note, the teaching team will not be responding to incoming emails or this discussion board on weekends or during the Mid-term break.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Students are encouraged to send an email request to the instructor if you have questions that are personal or specific to your individual situation, or if you would like to schedule a virtual office hour outside of the regularly scheduled office hours.</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Due Dates and Late Assignments</u></strong></p>
<p>All assignments are due at the times and dates listed in the course calendar. All times listed are set to Vancouver campus time (PST/PDT, UTC-7 hours). Students in different time zones will be responsible for converting to their own time/date to meet on time assignment deadlines.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<p><u>Marks reduction of 5% per 24 hours will result from late weekly discussion/participation, reflective learning journals, peer review, and research proposal assignments.</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With acknowledgement of the challenges to health we are all currently facing, final marks for the weekly discussion/participation assignments will be calculated as the best 8 out of 10 submissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the reflective learning journals, peer review and proposal assignments, all students will be able to claim two 24 hour-late ‘tokens’ or deadline extension to waive the 5% late penalty if needed.</p>
<p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<p><u>Marks reductions of 10% per 24 hours will result from any late submissions to the MultiMedia presentation/experiential learning assignment (April 6) or the Case Study written report (April 8).</u></p>
<p>Each student will have one 24-hour late ‘token’ to use as a waiver for late assignment submissions to either of these assignments.</p>
<p><strong>If you anticipate that you won't be able to meet an assignment deadline, and you would like to ‘claim’ one of these 24-hour late tokens, <u>you must communicate with the instructor by email with that request as soon as you are able.</u> Otherwise, your marks will be reduced by the late marks reduction standard as listed above.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Student Resources and Mental Health</u></strong></p>
<p>If you are having issues with stress, anxiety, or other mental health problems, please do not hesitate to contact the instructor and to reach out to the wide range of UBC resource persons who are focused on providing support in this arena.</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>International Students</u></strong></p>
<p>During this pandemic, the shift to online learning has greatly altered teaching and learning at UBC, including changes to health and safety considerations. Keep in mind that some UBC courses might cover topics that are censored or considered illegal by non-Canadian governments. This may include, but is not limited to, human rights, representative government, defamation, obscenity, gender or sexuality, and historical or current geopolitical controversies. If you are a student living abroad, you will be subject to the laws of your local jurisdiction, and your local authorities might limit your access to course material or take punitive action against you. UBC is strongly committed to academic freedom, but has no control over foreign authorities (please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://academic.ubc.ca/about-vp-academic/academic-values/advancing-academic-freedom#:~:text=Academic%20freedom%20consists%20of%20%E2%80%9Cthe,UBC%20Senate%20Statement%2C%201976).">here</a><u>.</u>&nbsp;for an articulation of the values of the University conveyed in the Senate Statement on Academic Freedom). Thus, we recognize that students will have legitimate reason to exercise caution in studying and researching certain subjects. If you have concerns regarding your personal situation, consider postponing taking a course with manifest risks, until you are back on campus or reach out to your academic advisor to find substitute courses. For further information and support, please visit:&nbsp;http://academic.ubc.ca/support-resources/freedom-expression</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="_Toc2236271"></a><u>Additional University Policies</u></p>
<p>UBC provides resources to support student learning, and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise, and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions.</p>
<p>Details of the policies and how to access support are available<strong> </strong>on<strong> </strong><a href="https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success"><strong>the UBC Senate website</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
