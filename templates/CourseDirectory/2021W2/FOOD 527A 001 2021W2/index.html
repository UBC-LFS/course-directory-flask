<p><strong>Course syllabus: Advanced Food Safety and Quality Management Systems, design, implementation, and internal and third-party audit methodology.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background: </strong></p>
<p>Currently, the food industry in the world and in Canada is undergoing a rapid upgrade of their food safety and food quality management systems, these new enhancements are customer-driven and based on global food safety standards as set forth by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) certified schemes. Food industries that embrace any of the GFSI schemes need to implement and pass a third-party audit to evaluate compliance, if the company is successful then it is certified.</p>
<p>Attaining global certification and maintaining these high expectation levels are now a requirement to do business. &nbsp;As a food safety and food quality professional having a good set of skills and a strong knowledge base on the GFSI systems is not only necessary but in today’s employment market a unique advantage.</p>
<p>Professionals in the food industry are catching up to these new systems, but currently, the courses available to them are at best a descriptive overview of the GFSI scheme codes, lacking tools for adequate interpretation and application of the requirements of the code into procedures and systems that are industry and product-specific, moreover, that can be translated into products that are safe and quality compliant.</p>
<p>Another characteristic of the GFSI models is their requirement to be in compliance with the supplier country’s food legislation.</p>
<p>Major retailers like Wal-Mart, COSTCO, Loblaw’s, Sobey’s are now requiring that all their food suppliers need to be GFSI certified, this trend continues to increase.</p>
<p>GFSI schemes are CODEX HACCP based and this methodology is used both to design and develop the food safety and the food quality management system, GMP’s, and pre-requisite programs, therefore manufacturing or food-handling sites are responsible for making its product, process, and plant-specific. This is no easy task, students learning these skills will be definitely at the forefront of the industry, from CEO, CFO, and other job positions, they all share some degree of responsibility under these total management systems.</p>
<p>This course is also informed by UN/FAO guidelines food safety, SQFI auditing guidelines, and ISO 19011:2018 Guidelines for auditing management systems, The National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Food (NACMCF), CFIA, and Safe Food for Canadians Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Strong knowledge of hazard analysis, risk assessment and risk management (HACCP Codex Alimentarius), food microbiology, toxicology, statistics for food safety and food quality control, and continuous improvement (KPI’s, SPC). Some knowledge of food sensory analysis is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this course is to familiarize students with food safety and quality principles of the GFSI systems schemes in particular with the SQF code, its interpretation, and implementation. The SQF Code is the most widely used in North America. Students will learn and apply auditing principles for internal, second, and third-party audits and in particular the guidelines for auditing the SQF Code.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong></p>
<p>Upon successful completion of this course students should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain the concept of GFSI and learning principles and techniques for auditing GFSI schemes</li>
<li>Gain an understanding of the SQF and BRC code requirements and how to implement these systems in food plants to attain GFSI certification</li>
<li>Work within a total quality management system to produce safe and quality food products that are compliant with a GFSI scheme code and local food legislation</li>
<li>Work in a continuous improvement environment using a dynamic system of key indicators</li>
<li>Audit food facilities and processes based on GFSI schemes, particularly SQF (Safe Quality Food) and BRC (British Retail Consortium) the most common systems used currently by the food industry in the American continent.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methodology:</strong></p>
<p>This is an intensive student-driven course; students will be given specific research assignments to be completed individually and/or in groups. These assignments will help the students gain understanding and knowledge of the class topics before attending class, in this fashion students will drive the discussion in class with the coordination of the professor.</p>
<p>Every week students will participate in making summaries, debating, and reaching conclusions for every topic of study that they have previously researched. The summaries will become the body of knowledge of the course and the exams.</p>
<p>Students will be compelled to work in groups to understand the steps to design and implement GMP’s and PP’s with hazard analysis and risk assessment approach and conciliate their findings to the requirements of the SQF Code for specific food processes and build up the guidelines to complete the implementation of these systems in case scenarios, writing policies, building programs, procedures, instructions, and records. This will provide insight into potential avenues to evaluate compliance during an audit.</p>
<p>Students will be divided into groups and given assignments to perform a third-party audit of specific food facility case scenarios based on real industry experiences. Upon completion, students will identify the deviations observed against the code requirements and how these could be resolved. For every element of the code that is deemed compliant, students will have to provide justification and evidence of compliance.</p>
<p>A mid-term exam will be performed on the principles learned.</p>
<p>The final exam is open book, students will evaluate and score NC’s based on specific food industry case scenarios and write their evidence/justification for the NC scoring.</p>
<p><strong>Course outline and details</strong></p>
<p><strong>Research/reading: </strong>What is GFSI? What are the schemes under GFSI? Review HACCP from Codex Alimentarius and element 2.4 Food Safety Plan from the SQF code version 8<strong>.</strong></p>
