<h2>Professional Communications Strategies</h2>
<h4>LWS 550 001 - Winter Term 2</h4>
<h4>Instructor: Julie Wilson (Email: <a href="mailto:julie.wilson@ubc.ca">julie.wilson@ubc.ca</a>)</h4>
<h4>Office: MCML 156B</h4>
<h4>Contact: <a href="mailto:julie.wilson@ubc.ca">julie.wilson@ubc.ca</a><strong> or </strong>604-822-6360</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strong communication skills and the ability to work cooperatively in a team are qualities that are consistently in demand by employers. It is particularly important to effectively communicate and collaborate on issues related to land and water, as they are inherently complex and involve multiple jurisdictions and stakeholders. We also live in a time where we have access to many tools that can enhance our communications by making them more engaging through online platforms and digital media. These tools can help to connect the science of land and water systems to non-scientists, such as planners, policy makers and members of the community.</p>

<h3>Course Format</h3>
<h4>Tuesday, Thursday 12:30 – 2:00 pm</h4>
<h4>Room: MCML 258<span style="color: #e03e2d;">*</span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #e03e2d;"><em>*NOTE: As health agencies continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 and the Omicron variant, an interim period of online learning will be in effect until February 7, 2022. Classes will be offered at the scheduled class time via Zoom.</em></span></p>
<p><span>Each class will consist of a lecture, class discussion/activity, small group work period or tutorial. See the schedule below for more details. This course uses the Canvas Learning Management System to support in-class activities. You will find lecture slides, readings, and assignment instructions here. You will also be expected to participate in online discussions and submit assignments via Canvas.</span></p>
<p><span>Guest speakers will be incorporated to complement depth and appropriate breadth of subject matter and current developments in communication strategies. Most tutorials will consist of hands-on sessions to facilitate learning about online and digital media tools, thus you will need a computer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong><em>COVID-19 Safety</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span>It is important that all of us feel as comfortable as possible engaging in class activities while sharing an indoor space. Non-medical masks that cover our noses and mouths are a primary tool to make it harder for COVID-19 to find a new host. Please wear a non-medical mask during our class meetings, for your own protection, and the safety and comfort of everyone else in the class. Please refrain from eating in class. If you need to drink water/coffee/tea/etc., please keep your mask on between sips. There may be students who have medical accommodations for not wearing a mask. Please maintain a respectful environment.

<p><span>If you have not yet had a chance to get vaccinated against COVID-19, vaccines are available to you for free [<a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/covid-19/vaccine/register">https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/covid-19/vaccine/register</a>]. The higher the rate of vaccination in our community overall, the lower the chance of spreading this virus. You are an important part of this community. Please arrange to get vaccinated if you have not already done so.</span></p>

<p><strong><u>Evaluation of Course Participation</u></strong></p>
<p>Participation is worth 20% of the LWS 550 course. Students are expected to attend all classes and actively engage in discussions and other participatory activities (<em>including Professional Ethics Case Studies, Environmental Round Table, Peer Evaluation of Student Writing, Hands-on Digital Media Tutorials, Team Project Activities, including developing a Team Charter, Communication Action Plan and Final Deliverable</em>), both in-person and online.</p>
<p>There are a variety of different modes in which students can contribute to the course learning environment and earn participation marks, designed for different preferences. These include synchronous verbal discussions (in-person and online), role-playing activity, synchronous Q &amp; A during lectures (both verbal and via chat), asynchronous written discussion questions and reflections on Canvas, group work, and peer evaluation (both in-person and in writing).</p>
<p>Course participation will be evaluated by the instructor, with marks and comments tabulated for each student throughout the duration of the course using the following evaluation rubric as a guide. A cumulative participation mark (worth 20%) will be recorded at the end of the course.</p>
<ul>
<li>A score of "1" would be awarded if the student had poor class attendance, failed to prepare for the class, had not listened carefully to what other classmates were saying, had either not communicated or communicated poorly during the class, had been disrespectful and/or had made no contribution in class.</li>
<li>A score of "2" would be awarded if the student’s awareness, listening skills, communication, respectfulness and contributions allowed the student to make small but limited contributions to the class discussion.</li>
<li>A score of "3" would be awarded if the student’s awareness, listening skills, communication, respectfulness and contributions allowed that student to participate actively and courteously in the class discussion and enhance the class’s understanding of the subject materials, the issues at hand and provide some suggestions for resolving the issues under discussion.</li>
<li>A score of "4" would be awarded if the student’s awareness was very good, listened carefully at all times to other classmates, communicated clearly, respected the contributions of other members and made a substantial contribution to the understanding and resolution of the issues in discussion.</li>
<li>A score of "5" would be awarded if the student demonstrated outstanding and/or excellent performance in any category. They consistently took a proactive, leadership position in activities and actively listened to and facilitated communications with other students to create a collaborative, enhanced learning environment.</li>
