<p><strong>Course Objective</strong></p>
<p>This course addresses advanced aspects of food processing concepts and technology and is intended as a transition course for graduate students. In addition, this course provides students with hands-on experience in the fundamental operations and principles employed in the food industry: <strong>thermal processing</strong>, <strong>dehydration,</strong><strong> size-reduction, and novel processing operations</strong>. Students will work in groups of 5-8 students to complete these <strong>3 laboratory modules</strong> by conducting experiments, collecting data and analyzing the results, and will submit a report at the end of each module. The laboratory component will be supplemented by<strong> 4 lecture modules (thermal processing, food dehydration, size reduction and homogenization, and novel processing technologies) and 2 self-study modules delivered via Flipped-Learning Group Lectures (food freezing and food packaging) </strong>that will review the fundamentals and introduce some advanced concepts in the field of food processing. For each of the modules, pre-reading materials will be provided with the applications discussed during the lecture hours.</p>
<p>Apart from this, <strong>recent developments in the field of food process science </strong>will be covered through group presentations. 3 groups of students (in groups of 5-8) will be involved in the preparation &amp; delivery of a presentation on either the 2 self-study modules, or the umbrella topic "Sustainability in Food Processing" to provide a broader picture of processing concepts and to enhance student’s technical knowledgebase. A term paper on the same topic will be submitted by each group that will summarize the concepts presented in the presentation, and as well highlight the recent developments in the last 5 years.</p>
<p>By the end of this course, students should be able to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Check</strong> the integrity of two different types of thermocouples and <strong>Calibrate</strong> them against an ASTM thermometer.</li>
<li><strong>Conduct</strong> a temperature distribution study, <strong>establish</strong> come-up time and measure the uniformity of the heating environment.</li>
<li><strong>Record</strong> time/temperature data using thermocouples, data-logger and associated software.</li>
<li><strong>Construct </strong>the heat penetration curve from a time-temperature data and <strong>Calculate</strong> the process lethality of a particular process or process time to achieve a particular lethality using various general and formula methods.</li>
