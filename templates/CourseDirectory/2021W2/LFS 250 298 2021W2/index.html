<p><strong>Land Acknowledgement</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>UBC’s Point Grey Campus is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xwməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam) people. The land it is situated on has always been a place of learning for the Musqueam people, who for millennia have passed on their culture, history, and traditions from one generation to the next on this site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LFS250-298 is a web-oriented course, and I am grateful to be instructing this course from the place where I call home that stands within the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territories of the <a href="https://native-land.ca/">Hul’qumi’num Treaty Group</a>. Many indigenous peoples thrive on the lands and waters we are acknowledging and are alive and strong.</p>

<p><strong>Course Instructor Brief Biographical Statement</strong></p>
<p>I am an Assistant Professor in the Applied Biology Program of the Faculty of Land and Food Systems with a part-time appointment. I have been teaching courses focused on Agroecology and Food Systems in our faculty since 2009. As a graduate student, I was a teaching assistant for three of the Land, Food, and Community (LFC) core courses, and have been involved with teaching and learning with the LFC community of learners since 2006. My areas of research and practice are focused on soil health centered best practices with an agroecological lens. I am also a full-time farmer living and working my family’s 40-acre farm on Vancouver Island. My research collaborations with the Sustainable Agriculture Landscapes Lab and Dr. Sean Smukler connect our farm with a wider network of regionally focused on-farm investigations.</p>

<p><strong><u>Course Description</u></strong></p>
<p>Land, Food and Community I (LFS 250) is part of the Land, Food, and Community (LFC) series, the academic core of all programs in the Faculty of Land and Food Systems. The objective of the LFC series is to create learning opportunities that encourage students to become citizens, professionals, and leaders who understand the opportunities and obstacles to creating regional, national, and global food systems that are ecologically, socially, and economically sustainable.</p>
<p>In LFS 250, we begin the process of becoming food systems thinkers by analyzing global and regional food systems through theory and personal experience. By participating in interdisciplinary group work, students learn about complex food system issues and how their disciplines contribute to addressing food system sustainability, food justice, food security, food citizenship and food sovereignty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Course Structure</u></strong></p>
<p>This section of LFS250 (298), focused on an exploration of ‘Land, Food, and Community’, was designed primarily as a web-based course. All of the course content, from required readings and viewings, to discussions, links for communications with your peers and the teaching team, <em>and</em> your assignments, will be submitted via the Canvas course website.</p>
<p>Students will need to familiarize themselves with how to navigate the Canvas course website, learn quickly where and how to submit each assignment, and take responsibility for communicating regularly with classmates and the teaching team as an integral part of this 6-credit course. You will be expected to engage in the course with learning activities and assignments multiple times per week during the term.</p>
<p>Though the course is delivered online, building skills and establishing a&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">regular practice with collaborative and social learning </span>(in LFS250 this is referred to as the ‘community of learners’) is an important learning objective here. You will be asked to keep pace on a weekly basis and contribute to group discussions, to respectfully communicate with team members, and collaborate and complete team assignments as part of the course learning objectives.</p>
<p>To that end, building skills and continued practice with collaborative and social learning is an important learning objective of the course and may require flexibility and coordination of your schedule. You will be asked to regularly contribute to discussions, to respectfully provide timely peer review and feedback as part of the course learning assessment.</p>
<p>In response to student feedback and some of the identified additional pressures on online learning during the global COVID19 pandemic, this term I will also offer several opportunities for ‘live’ or synchronous and informal discussion with the goal of supporting each student in the preparation of specific course assignments. These will be organized virtual office hours sessions that include student driven Q&amp;A discussions or project workshops, and will take place on Zoom, scheduled with your feedback from a beginning of term student survey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Course Schedule</u></strong></p>
<p>The schedule for the course will be organized on a weekly basis, with written assignments, as well as multimedia and self-assessment survey assignments due on a regular basis on Wednesdays and Fridays. Larger written assignments will be due at the end (or beginning) of each month of the term on a Monday. The weekly course schedule can be found on the LFS250 (298) home page in Canvas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any change to the course schedule will be communicated with Canvas Course Announcements and an updated version of the course schedule will be posted on the corresponding Canvas course page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>See the Weekly Course Schedule linked on the Canvas home page and the Assignments tab link on left side navigation in Canvas for complete list of due dates, detailed assignment instructions, and marking rubrics. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The accepted format for all written assignments is the American Psychological Association (APA) format.&nbsp;<u>You are expected to follow this format for all written assignments. </u></strong>In brief, the APA writing style aims to promote objectivity in communicating science, and the APA format is a means to standardize reports across the scientific community (Schwartz, Landrum, &amp; Guring, 2013). More detailed information about this format, including how to cite references correctly can be found&nbsp;here <u>Links to an external site.</u>&nbsp;and&nbsp;here<u>&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</u>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Contacting the instructor and office hours</u></strong></p>
<p>If you have general questions about the course content or assignments, please first post these to the Canvas course <u>Frequently Asked Questions/FAQS Discussion</u> Board.On the FAQS discussion board, anyone in the course may helpfully respond—another student, the instructor, or your TA. Please note, the teaching team will not be responding to incoming emails or this discussion board on weekends or during the Mid-term break.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Students are encouraged to send an email request to the instructor if you have questions that are personal or specific to your individual situation, or if you would like to schedule a virtual office hour outside of the regularly schedule office hours.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Due Dates and Late Assignments</u></strong></p>
<p>All assignments are due at the times and dates listed in the course calendar. All times listed are set to Vancouver campus time (PST/PDT, UTC-7 hours). Students in different time zones will be responsible for converting to their own time/date to meet on time assignment deadlines.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<p><u>Marks reduction of 5% per 24 hours will result from late weekly discussion, self assessment survey or peer review assignments.</u></p>
<p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<p><u>Marks reductions of 10% per 24 hours will result from late submissions to the Position Papers or Key Concept Essay</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requests for accommodation to assignment due dates</span></p>
<p>With acknowledgement of the challenges to health we are all currently facing, final marks for the weekly discussion assignments will be calculated as the best 8 out of 10 submissions.</p>
<p>For all assignments other than these weekly discussions with the best 8/10 accommodation as noted, each student will have four 24-hour late ‘tokens’ to use as a waiver for late assignment submissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you anticipate that you won't be able to meet an assignment deadline, and you would like to ‘claim’ one of these 24-hour late tokens, <u>you must communicate with the instructor by email with that request as soon as you are able.</u> Otherwise, your marks will be reduced by the late marks reduction standard as listed above.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Student Resources and Mental Health</u></strong></p>
<p>If you are having issues with stress, anxiety, or other mental health problems, please do not hesitate to contact the instructor and to reach out to the wide range of UBC resource persons who are focused on providing support in this arena.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>International Students</u></strong></p>
<p>During this pandemic, the shift to online learning has greatly altered teaching and learning at UBC, including changes to health and safety considerations. Keep in mind that some UBC courses might cover topics that are censored or considered illegal by non-Canadian governments. This may include, but is not limited to, human rights, representative government, defamation, obscenity, gender or sexuality, and historical or current geopolitical controversies. If you are a student living abroad, you will be subject to the laws of your local jurisdiction, and your local authorities might limit your access to course material or take punitive action against you. UBC is strongly committed to academic freedom, but has no control over foreign authorities (please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://academic.ubc.ca/about-vp-academic/academic-values/advancing-academic-freedom#:~:text=Academic%20freedom%20consists%20of%20%E2%80%9Cthe,UBC%20Senate%20Statement%2C%201976).">here</a><u>.</u>&nbsp;for an articulation of the values of the University conveyed in the Senate Statement on Academic Freedom). Thus, we recognize that students will have legitimate reason to exercise caution in studying and researching certain subjects. If you have concerns regarding your personal situation, consider postponing taking a course with manifest risks, until you are back on campus or reach out to your academic advisor to find substitute courses. For further information and support, please visit:&nbsp;http://academic.ubc.ca/support-resources/freedom-expression</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<u>Additional University Policies</u></p>
<p>UBC provides resources to support student learning, and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise, and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions.</p>
<p>Details of the policies and how to access support are available<strong> </strong>on<strong> </strong><a href="https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success"><strong>the UBC Senate website</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
