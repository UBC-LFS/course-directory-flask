<p><strong>Land Acknowledgement</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>UBC’s Point Grey Campus is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xwməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam) people. The land it is situated on has always been a place of learning for the Musqueam people, who for millennia have passed on their culture, history, and traditions from one generation to the next on this site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>APBI361 is a web-oriented course, and I am grateful to be instructing this course from the place where I call home that stands within the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territories of the <a href="https://native-land.ca/">Hul’qumi’num Treaty Group</a>. Many indigenous peoples thrive on the lands and waters we are acknowledging and are alive and strong.</p>

<p><strong>Course Instructor Brief Biographical Statement</strong></p>
<p>I am an Assistant Professor in the Applied Biology Program of the Faculty of Land and Food Systems with a part-time appointment. I have been teaching courses focused on Agroecology and Food Systems in our faculty since 2009. As a graduate student, I was a teaching assistant for this course, and have been working to provide student-centered updates on the course content since 2015. My areas of research and practice are focused on soil health centered best practices with an agroecological lens. I am also a full-time farmer living and working my family’s 40-acre farm on Vancouver Island. My research collaborations with the Sustainable Agriculture Landscapes Lab and Dr. Sean Smukler connect our farm with a wider network of regionally focused on-farm investigations.</p>

<p><strong><u>Course Description</u></strong></p>
<p>APBI361 offers an exploration of contemporary models and measurements of sustainable agriculture as developed by policymakers, non-government organizations, academic researchers, and for-profit commercial enterprises. Students will encounter the complexity, challenges, and limits of sustainability indicators at global, national, and regional scales.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Course Structure</u></strong></p>
<p>APBI361, centered on a study of the ‘Key Indicators of Agroecosystem Sustainability’, was designed primarily as a web-based course. Review of course materials and a majority, but not all, course assignments can be completed with a regular schedule of asynchronous learning activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The course goal is to provide an opportunity for students to explore the ways agriculture and food systems sustainability is measured, and to critically examine these sustainability assessments with support from peers and the teaching team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To that end, building skills and continued practice with collaborative and social learning is an important learning objective of the course and may require flexibility and coordination of your schedule. You will be asked to regularly contribute to discussions, to respectfully provide timely peer review and feedback as part of the course learning assessment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Course readings and all assignments will all be located within the APBI361 Canvas course website. Students will need to familiarize themselves with how to navigate the site, where and how to submit each assignment, and take responsibility for communicating regularly with classmates and the instructor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In response to student feedback and some of the identified additional pressures on online learning during the global COVID19 pandemic, this term I will also offer several opportunities for ‘live’ or synchronous and informal discussion with the goal of supporting each student in the preparation of specific course assignments, and more importantly, to meet course learning objectives. These will be organized as student driven Q&amp;A discussions or project workshops, and will take place on Zoom, scheduled with your feedback from a beginning of term student survey.</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Course Schedule</u></strong></p>
<p>The schedule for the course will be organized on a weekly basis, with all written assignments due on Wednesdays and Fridays. The weekly course schedule can be found on the APBI361 home page in Canvas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any change to the course schedule will be communicated with Canvas Course Announcements and an updated version of the course schedule will be posted on the corresponding Canvas course page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="_Toc2236267"></a><strong><u>Learning Outcomes</u></strong></p>
<p>Upon completion of APBI361, students will be able to:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The accepted format for all written assignments is the American Psychological Association (APA) format.&nbsp;<u>You are expected to follow this format for all written assignments. </u></strong>In brief, the APA writing style aims to promote objectivity in communicating science, and the APA format is a means to standardize reports across the scientific community (Schwartz, Landrum, &amp; Guring, 2013). More detailed information about this format, including how to cite references correctly can be found&nbsp;here <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://guides.library.ubc.ca/apacitationstyle" target="_blank"><u>Links to an external site.</u></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;here<u> <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html" target="_blank">Links to an external site</a></u>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Indicators MultiMedia Project Assignment is intended to offer an opportunity to demonstrate that students have met key course learning objectives with reflections, inspiration, and communication forms that reach beyond traditional academic audiences and include other ways of learning and knowing. The <strong>Canvas assignment dropbox has limitations for accepted file format type and file size that sets the expectations for acceptable submissions of this assignment.</strong> The details for acceptable file formats and file size for this assignment are found in the Indicators Media Project assignment description, linked with the Assignments tab on the course Canvas site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Contacting the instructor and office hours</u></strong></p>
<p>If you have general questions about the course content or assignments, please first post these to the Canvas course <a title="Course Q &amp; A  or Frequently Asked Questions (FAQS) Forum" href="https://ubc.beta.instructure.com/courses/82112/discussion_topics/1227426" data-api-endpoint="https://ubc.beta.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/82112/discussion_topics/1227426" data-api-returntype="Discussion"><u>Frequently Asked Questions/FAQS Discussion</u></a> Board.On the FAQS discussion board, anyone in the course may helpfully respond—another student, the instructor, or your TA. Please note, the teaching team will not be responding to incoming emails or this discussion board on weekends or during the Mid-term break.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Students are encouraged to send an email request to the instructor if you have questions that are personal or specific to your individual situation, or if you would like to schedule a virtual office hour outside of the regularly scheduled office hours.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During my regularly scheduled weekly office hours, feel free to connect with me via Zoom. Please 'drop-in' anytime during this hour without making an appointment to ask me questions or discuss anything related to the course. You will initially be put into the meeting waiting room, and I will let you in as soon as I am free.</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Due Dates and Late Assignments</u></strong></p>
<p>All assignments are due at the times and dates listed in the course calendar. All times listed are set to Vancouver campus time (PST/PDT, UTC-7 hours). Students in different time zones will be responsible for converting to their own time/date to meet on time assignment deadlines.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<p><u>Marks reduction of 5% per 24 hours will result from late weekly discussion or peer review assignments.</u></p>
<p><u>Marks reductions of 10% per 24 hours will result from late submissions to the Project Outline/Draft assignment (March 4), the Indicators Media Project Assignment (April1), and/or the Indicators Written project Report (April 8).</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With acknowledgement of the challenges to health we are all currently facing, final marks for the weekly discussion assignments will be calculated as the best 9 out of 10 submissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, each student will have two 48-hour late ‘tokens’ to use as a waiver for late assignment submissions to the any of the peer review assignments, or Project Outline/Draft assignment (March 4), the Indicators Media Project Assignment (April 1), and/or the Indicators Written project Report (April 8).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you anticipate that you won't be able to meet an assignment deadline, and you would like to ‘claim’ one of these 48-hour late tokens, <u>you must communicate with the instructor by email with that request as soon as you are able.</u> Otherwise, your marks will be reduced by the late marks reduction standard as listed above.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Student Resources and Mental Health</u></strong></p>
<p>If you are having issues with stress, anxiety or other mental health problems, please do not hesitate to contact the instructor and to reach out to the wide range of UBC resource persons who are focused on providing support in this arena.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>International Students</u></strong></p>
<p>During this pandemic, the shift to online learning has greatly altered teaching and learning at UBC, including changes to health and safety considerations. Keep in mind that some UBC courses might cover topics that are censored or considered illegal by non-Canadian governments. This may include, but is not limited to, human rights, representative government, defamation, obscenity, gender or sexuality, and historical or current geopolitical controversies. If you are a student living abroad, you will be subject to the laws of your local jurisdiction, and your local authorities might limit your access to course material or take punitive action against you. UBC is strongly committed to academic freedom, but has no control over foreign authorities (please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://academic.ubc.ca/about-vp-academic/academic-values/advancing-academic-freedom#:~:text=Academic%20freedom%20consists%20of%20%E2%80%9Cthe,UBC%20Senate%20Statement%2C%201976).">here</a><u>.</u>&nbsp;for an articulation of the values of the University conveyed in the Senate Statement on Academic Freedom). Thus, we recognize that students will have legitimate reason to exercise caution in studying and researching certain subjects. If you have concerns regarding your personal situation, consider postponing taking a course with manifest risks, until you are back on campus or reach out to your academic advisor to find substitute courses.

<p>&nbsp;<a name="_Toc2236271"></a><u>Additional University Policies</u></p>
<p>UBC provides resources to support student learning, and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise, and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions.</p>
