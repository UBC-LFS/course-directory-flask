<p><span>This course teaches you to use audio technology and a journalistic framework in order to tell powerful stories and present academic content in new ways. It is a seminar course with a lot of personal attention, critical feedback and weekly lab-based work. By the end of the term, students will have the ability to share their knowledge in effective and creative ways.</span></p>
<p><span>We acknowledge that the UBC Point Grey campus is situated on the traditional, ancestral and unceded territory of the Musqueam people. Given the remote nature of the start of this term, students are encouraged to think about the history of the land that they work and live on.</span></p>

<p><span>Each student will create a one-minute podcast based on interviews (i.e., a 60- second-long series of questions and answers recorded and edited by the "student reporter"). The topic/question is decided in advance in consultation with instructors and should connect to the student's academic interests (i.e., a topic within LFS's domain). Students are encouraged to record at least five people (at least one of whom should be recorded remotely and must follow public health guidelines) to record their comments/opinions/ideas on the questions&nbsp;</span><span>asked. Once recorded, the collected material (no more than 10 mins)</span><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;is to be transcribed (this is a tool for characterizing the material you have gathered—from there you will make editorial choices about which audio you will use) and transferred to a digital editing system (e.g., Audacity) and edited for time and content. Final 'streeters' should demonstrate technical proficiencies as follows:</span></p>
