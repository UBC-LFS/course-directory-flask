<p>Course Structure</p>
<p>This course is part two in a series of two Nutrition Care courses required for students in the dietetics major.</p>
<p>This course will consist of two 80-minute classes weekly, plus online learning that is complimentary to course content and is to be done outside of class time.&nbsp; Most classes will be held in person if/when it is possible to do so based on University and British Columbia COVID guidelines and protocols. At this time UBC has transitioned to online teaching/learning through January 24, 2022. Please watch for updates and advisories as we monitor whether classes will remain online or transition back in person at some point this term. Online classes will be held weekly during class time through the class zoom link in Canvas.</p>
<p>Time in class will include lecture-style teaching, guest lectures, group work, and participation in problem-based learning through in-class cases. Students are expected to come to each class having completed pre-assigned learning which may include reading journal articles, practice guidelines, the textbook, or videos posted to canvas.</p>
<p>Please do not attend class if you are not feeling well. If you are unable to attend a class due to reasons related to COVID-19, please notify the instructors. Slide sets for each class will be posted ahead of the class. Each class will be voice recorded and posted so you will be able to review the classes after they take place. Materials for in-class activities will also be posted so you will be able to review them should you need to miss a class. &nbsp;We do require permission from guest speakers to record them, and some prefer not to have their content recorded so it may not be possible to post recorded content from every guest lecture. If this is the case, please reach out to a classmate to obtain notes from the missed class. If you are not able to do this for any reason, please contact the course instructors for assistance.</p>
<p>The midterm and final exam will be written in person if COVID restrictions allow. If you are unable to make it due to reasons related to COVID-19 please contact the instructors ASAP so we can arrange for alternate plans. Please do not plan any non-essential travel etc. that may require you to isolate in the weeks leading up to the midterm and exam. If current COVID restrictions do not allow for in-person exams alternate plans will be made and the class will be updated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CoVID SAFETY</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For our in-person meetings in this class, it is important that all of us feel as comfortable as possible engaging in class activities while sharing an indoor space.&nbsp; Non-medical masks that cover our noses and mouths are a primary tool to make it harder for COVID-19 to find a new host.&nbsp; Please wear a non-medical mask during our class meetings, for your own protection, and the safety and comfort of everyone else in the class. If you have not yet had a chance to get vaccinated against COVID-19, vaccines are available to you free of charge on campus. The higher the rate of vaccination in our community overall, the lower the chance of spreading this virus.&nbsp; You are an important part of this community. Please arrange to get vaccinated if you have not already done so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Mask wearing</h2>
<p>The Provincial Health Officer, the Minister of Advanced Education and Skills Training, and the Minister of Education announced a new Public Health Order requiring non-medical masks came into effect on August 25, 2021 for all indoor public areas on both UBC campuses, including classrooms, labs, lobbies, hallways, stairwells, and elevators. The Order also applies to anyone taking public transportation, in a taxi or ride-sharing vehicle, and in many other settings (<span><a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2021HLTH0053-001665">https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2021HLTH0053-001665</a></span><u>)</u>.&nbsp; Further details can be found at <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><span><a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/covid-19/info/restrictions#masks">https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/covid-19/info/restrictions#masks</a></span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Learning Activities</p>
<p>This class involves a variety of learning activities and teaching modalities that are designed to teach course concepts and challenge students to develop sound clinical reasoning skills. Learning activities involve a combination of individual and small-group learning activities. Learning activities include assigned videos and readings, lecture-style and problem-based learning in class, case study assignments, practice questions and review questions. <br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learning Materials</p>
<p>Canvas will be used as the online learning platform for the course. Course notes will be posted prior to each class and learning materials required for each unit will be posted under the respective unit on the “Modules” page of the course Canvas site. <br>Students will be permitted to bring pre-specified cheat sheets into exams, and these will also be posted on the canvas website.</p>
<p><strong>Required LEARNING MATERIALS</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nelms &amp; Sucher. Nutrition and Pathophysiology (4e). 2020. Cengage Learning.</li>
<li>Medical Nutrition Therapy – A Case Study Approach. Thompson Books. (5e). 2017.</li>
<li>Canadian Journal of Diabetes, Diabetes Canada 2018 Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Diabetes in Canada (Online or an app is available)</li>
<li>Additional readings and links to videos will be posted under each module on Canvas</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>OPTIONAL LEARNING MATERIALS: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Diet Analysis Software is not mandatory to complete the case studies.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assessments of Learning</p>
<p><strong>Problem-based case studies</strong><strong>: </strong>Students will complete 3 case-study assignments based on the book by Nelms and Roth (5e) Medical Nutrition Therapy – A Case Study Approach. Please refer to the case study questions posted on Canvas, as there are some differences between the posted questions and those found in the case study text (due to differences in Canadian vs. US healthcare systems and material covered). Two of these case studies will be completed in groups of 2-3, and one will be completed individually. <em><u>Students must remain in the same groups throughout the term. Students are expected to work collaboratively on each of the case studies, as these are critical skills building towards the practice education year.</u></em> Case study assignments must be completed and submitted in pdf format <strong><u>by 11pm</u> on the due date indicated above</strong> in the course evaluation table. <em><u>Late submissions will <strong>not</strong> be accepted. Case study submissions are subject to a page <strong>limit of 12 pages </strong>(excluding a reference page). Any pages over 12 will not be marked. </u></em></p>
<p>Answer keys for the case studies will not be provided, however a printed copy of the answer key will be available in the instructor’s office after each assignment is due. Students are encouraged to come view the answer keys available to aid in learning course content.</p>
<p><strong>Midterm and Final exams:</strong><strong> </strong>The midterm and final exam will be cumulative. These examinations may include multiple choice questions, true/false (correct the false) questions, matching questions, and short answer/case study questions. These examinations are closed book, however cheat sheets (reference documents) will be provided by the instructor. If you require special accommodation for exam writing, please ensure you notify the instructor at least 3 weeks ahead of the scheduled exam.</p>
<p><strong><u>Cheat Sheets for Examinations:</u></strong> Pre-specified cheat sheets (reference documents) will be provided with exams. Students are not permitted to bring their own copy into the exams with them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If students have questions about marks given on a midterm or final examination, they may bring these concerns to the instructor. If there is a request to review an exam for re-grading, the instructor will look at the entire exam, not just the question of concern. In this case the review of grading may result in adjustment to marking of any questions and may result in an increase or decrease of the student’s overall grade on the exam.</p>
<p><strong>TEam reflection tool: </strong>To ensure that your team gets the support you need to complete your case-study assignments, this tool (worth 5% of your final mark) will be filled out by each member of your team and require an assessment on the strengths and weaknesses of your group. This will be required at mid-point in the semester so that instructor can help trouble-shoot any difficult group dynamics. The form is to be submitted via Canvas.</p>
<p>Missed assignments or exams: Missed assignments will not be graded, and marks will be lost. In the case that a student must miss an exam due to unforeseen circumstances, documentation must be provided as per<span><a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,795,874"> Faculty</a></span> and <span><a href="https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/exams/exam-clashes-hardships-cancellations">University Policy</a></span>. A make-up exam will be scheduled.</p>

<p>University Policies</p>
<p>UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions.</p>
<p>Details of the policies and how to access support are available<strong> </strong>on<strong> </strong><span><a href="https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success"><strong>the UBC Senate website</strong></a></span><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other Course Policies</p>
<p><strong>Course Linkage to ICDEP:</strong> This course, like all required courses in the Dietetics Major, contributes to coverage of the&nbsp;<em>Integrated Competencies for Dietetic Education and Practice (ICDEP)</em>.&nbsp; All students in the Dietetics Major should refer to the <span><a href="http://dietetics.landfood.ubc.ca/about/mapping-of-curriculum-to-icdep/"><strong>Mapping of Curriculum to ICDEP</strong></a></span> page on the dietetics website to familiarize themselves with the requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Learning Analytics</p>
<p>Learning analytics includes the collection and analysis of data about learners to improve teaching and learning. This course will be using the following learning technologies: Canvas</p>
<p>Many of these tools capture data about your activity and provide information that can be used to improve the quality of teaching and learning. In this course, I plan to use analytics data to:</p>
<ul>
<li>View overall class progress</li>
<li>Review statistics on course content being accessed to support improvements in the course</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning Resources</p>
<p><strong>UBC Canvas: </strong>Notes will be posted ahead of class. Guest lecture notes will be posted as soon as they are available, if permission is granted by the guest speaker. Additional Readings specified throughout the term will be posted in each unit folder on Canvas. These readings are provided for further enrichment and to broaden understanding beyond lecture notes, text, case studies and guest presentations.</p>
